Biogeochemistry,1987,"GRIMM, NB",NITROGEN DYNAMICS DURING SUCCESSION IN A DESERT STREAM,"Nitrogen dynamics of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a lowland Sonoran Desert stream, are described by seven diel input-output budgets at different stages of postflood succession. Hydrologic inputs and outputs of nitrogen and N storage in periphyton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were measured over 24-h periods. Total nitrogen storage in this desert stream (3-9 g/m2) was lower than that in forest streams of Oregon (12 g/m2) and Quebec (22 g/m2). While > 99% of nitrogen in the latter systems is in allochthonous detritus, benthic algae and autochthonous detritus comprised 90% of the total nitrogen pool in the desert stream. Up to 14% of nitrogen was in consumer organisms. Inputs of nitrogen to the stream ecosystem were dominated by dissolved nitrogen, of which 19-60% was inorganic, primarily nitrate. Particulate nitrogen in transport (4-15% of total input) was mostly autochthonous. Inputs of nitrogen exceeded outputs on most study dates. Rates of ecosystem nitrogen retention were as high as 400 mg m-2 d-' and outputs exceeded inputs on only one study date. Retention was primarily of inorganic nitrogen and was presumed due to autotrophic assimilation. Nitrogen retention data from the seven budgets were used to evaluate the Vitousek and Reiners (1975) model that patterns of nitrogen retention during succession reflect patterns of net ecosystem production and biomass accumulation. Biomass and stored nitrogen increased asymptotically during a postflood successional sequence at a single site; nitrogen retention during this period accounted for increases in storage. Nitrogen retention among the seven study dates exhibited the predicted successional patterns of increases from early to middle successional stages, followed by late stage declines.",ECOLOGY,68,5,,1157,1170,,10.2307/1939200,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:A1987K221900002

It describes the present understanding of dryland rivers, using a theoretical framework with examples and results of research from many areas of the world. The most important feature of this book is that it represents the first organized review of the knowledge about dryland rivers. Information on practical management and planning is also included. The book stresses the philosophical and methodological aspects of geomorphologic research, rather than merely reporting results. Scientists may expect to use the work frequently as a guide to the literature, an intellectual review of previous ideas in the field, and an indication of where further work is needed. Planners and decision makers in dryland regions may expect to use the book as an entre to the science of geomorphology as applied to dryland environments.",Fluvial processes in dryland rivers,,,,xiv+346 pp,xiv+346 pp,,,,,,,,,,INSPEC:3265485

Ingestion provided a better measure of diel feeding periodicity than gut fullness; feeding was diurnal on both sample dates, but more markedly so when the primary food was algae. Mean nitrogen content of algal foods was low, andÿA. chrysogasterapparently compensated for this by increasing its daily ingestion rate when algae were the major food. A reduction in nitrogen content of food during digestion from 4?6% (of dry mass) to less than 1% (in feces) suggested a high assimilation efficiency for nitrogen (nitrogen assimilated/nitrogen consumed = 72?78%). Populations of this abundant and successful cyprinid in Sonoran Desert streams may play an important role in ecosystem nitrogen dynamics. Nitrogen stored in fish biomass comprised 3?6% of the total nitrogen stored in Sycamore Creek, and excretion of ammonia by the fish represented 5?10% of total nitrogen uptake by algae.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",1991,"BELILLAS, CM; RODA, F",NUTRIENT BUDGETS IN A DRY HEATHLAND WATERSHED IN NORTHEASTERN SPAIN,"Dissolved nutrient inputs in bulk precipitation and outputs in streamwater were measured during 3 years of contrasting hydrological conditions in a 6.3-ha, grazed heathland watershed on schists in the Montseny mountains (NE Spain), drained by an intermittent stream. On average, 39% of the precipitation became streamflow. Bulk precipitation delivered positive net alkalinity (mean 0.22 keq/ha/yr), sulphate input was moderate (9.0 kg SO4-S/ha/yr), and the mean input of inorganic N was not exceptionally high (6.6 kg/ha/yr). Ion concentrations were relatively low in streamwater; SO4(2-) was the dominant anion. Most concentrations in streamwater varied seasonally, with maxima in late summer or early autumn and minima in spring. This pattern probably resulted from increased availability of ions for leaching due to decomposition of organic matter and chemical weathering during the warm period. Nitrate concentrations were relatively high in winter and dropped sharply in early spring, probably because of biological uptake. Annual element outputs in streamwater varied between years and seemed to be controlled by both the amount of annual streamflow and its seasonal distribution. Annual inputs exceeded outputs for dissolved inorganic N. The watershed accumulated H+ and Ca2+, had net losses of Na+ and Mg2+, and was close to steady state for K+, SO4(2-), Cl- and alkalinity. The chloride budgets gave no evidence of substantial dry deposition in this system. The cationic denudation rate was negative (-0.14 keq/ha/yr) because Ca2+ retention was higher than net exports of Na+ and Mg2+ from silicate weathering. Low nutrient export and little production of alkalinity suggest that this watershed has a low buffering capacity.",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,13,2,,137,157,,,,,,,,0168-2563,,WOS:A1991GH74100003

Fine mesh (63-mu-m) traps filled with defaunated sediment and open to recolonization from upstream, downstream or below were buried 30 cm deep in the hyporheic zone of a gravel run in a desert stream and recovered after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 27 days. Temporal changes in organic matter and faunal composition and abundance were compared among treatments and with those in completely closed 'control' traps.2. Closed traps consistently contained little detritus (< 30 mg AFDM per 5000 cm3). Traps facing upstream accumulated significantly more organic matter than those facing below or downstream, indicating downstream hyporheic transport of fine particulate detritus.3. Upstream-facing traps also captured significantly greater numbers of taxa and individuals. Low numbers of most taxa recolonized from all three directions within 1 day; total densities of individuals in the traps increased before levelling off after 2 weeks.4. The prediction that taxa with planktonic epigean relatives (e.g. cyclopoid copepods) would predominate in upstream facing traps was unsupported, nor did unpigmented, blind phreatic forms preferentially colonize traps from below. Two closely related taxa exhibited major differences in recolonization dynamics, illustrating the risk of masking such trends when pooling data for more than one taxon.5.

Invertebrate,1991,"BROOKS, SS; BOULTON, AJ",RECOLONIZATION DYNAMICS OF BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES AFTER ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL DISTURBANCES IN AN AUSTRALIAN TEMPORARY STREAM,"The effects of substratum particle size (cobbles, coarse gravel and medium-fine gravel) on recolonization by benthic macroinvertebrates after disturbance was investigated in small plots (0.05 m2) in the Finniss River, an intermittent stream in South Australia. Six weeks after flow resumed, the intermediate particle size (coarse gravel) supported the greatest densities of taxa and individuals. Experimental disturbance reduced species richness by 83% and numbers of individuals by 97%. Rapid recolonizers (e.g. mayfly and stonefly nymphs) showed little substratum specificity and attained predisturbance densities within one day. Slow recolonizers (e.g. chironomid hatchlings) favoured gravel substrata and had not reached predisturbance densities within 4 days. Recolonization of small plots appeared to be by surface movement from neighbouring intact areas. A spate on Day 7 prevented further sampling, destroying all experimental plots, but this permitted a study of macroinvertebrate recolonization following a natural disturbance at a larger spatial scale. The spate reduced species richness by 45% and numbers of individuals by 70%. Vertical migration rather than drift appeared to be the major source of recolonizing fauna. Our data show that results from small-scale experiments can not be extrapolated to large-scale disturbance because the scale of disturbance strongly influences the rate and pathways of recolonization as well as the sources and faunal composition of the recolonists.",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,42,3,,295,308,,,,,,,,0067-1940,,WOS:A1991FQ36500006

The stream consisted of about 20 pools separated by dry streambed except during two floods and subsequent brief periods of flow. Individually recognizable tags permitted mark-recapture estimates of population size and information on individual movements. The first flood was very severe, with pools losing an average of 75% of their populations (range 12-99%). Most of the lost fish died by becoming trapped in desiccating pools. Males and juveniles were more likely to be lost than were females. Population loss was negatively related to pool volume and positively related to streambed slope. In addition, population loss was positively related to pre-flood population size when the effects of pool volume and slope were removed indicating that pools with higher densities lost more fish. Of the fish recaptured after the flood, the average proportion found in the pool in which they had been tagged varied from 16%-96%, depending on the area of the stream. Of fish that moved, 92% went downstream. The second flood was less severe though stream flow lasted as long, and there was little effect on the pool populations. Involuntary flushing during the flood and voluntary departure apparently interacted to produce the observed patterns.",OECOLOGIA,87,2,,299,306,,10.1007/BF00325270,,,,,,0029-8549,,WOS:A1991FX12200019

Among pools, population densities were not correlated with their pre-flood values, and the population growth rates showed a weak negative correlation with density, a marginal positive correlation with periphyton production and no correlation with oxygen.(3) Near the end of the 153-day post-flood study period, population sizes had risen to 50% of their pre-flood values, while pool areas had fallen to 73% of their pre-flood values. Periphyton production was relatively high and dissolved oxygen was very low. Among pools, population densities were correlated with their pre-flood values, and the population growth rate showed a strong negative correlation with population density and strong positive correlations with periphyton production and dissolved oxygen level.(4) These results suggest that in highly seasonal tropical environments, temporal patterns of population abundance in high-gradient streams will be very different from those in floodplains, where the rainy season is a time of increase and the dry season a time of decline. Spatial variation in environmental characteristics which control periphyton, detritus and oxygen availability may produce characteristic population densities in different pools. An increase in the proportion of males and a decrease in their size after the floods suggest social inhibition of sexual maturation during the late dry season.",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,60,2,,441,453,,10.2307/5289,,,,,,0021-8790,,WOS:A1991FT29200005

In stratigraphic sections, metal ratios discriminate between pre-industrial alluvium and post-industrial flood deposits. On valley floors, channels and active alluvium have the highest metal concentrations, while other process environments have decreasing amounts associated with decreasing frequencies of inundation. Materials from the mine tailings become progressively diluted with increasing distance from the source. Metals appear to be chemically stable once they are precipitated and adsorbed in the alkaline dryland conditions. Spatial variability of metal concentrations are more important than variability associated with particle size in explaining the fate of contaminants in the fluvial sediment system.",CATENA,18,6,,567,582,,10.1016/0341-8162(91)90039-Z,,,,,,0341-8162,,WOS:A1991GV02900003

The objective of this study was to determine how changes in these two factors affected the structure of an algal assemblage in an ephemeral stream. Coverslips were incubated for 21 days in enclosures containing one of three nutrient environments (ambient, phosphorus-enriched, or phosphorus and nitrogen enriched) and one of four densities of the snail Goniobasis (0, 40, 80, or 120 snails/m2) and examined directly to enumerate the algal assemblage. The effect of grazing on algal biomass was dependent on the nutrient environment. An overstory of diatoms was susceptible to removal by grazing and was not strongly affected by nutrient enrichment. An understory of Stigeoclonium was more resistant to grazing and responded strongly to nutrient enrichment only in the presence of grazers. Snail grazers may mediate nutrient availability to the understory indirectly by removing overlying cells or by direct excretion of nutrients. Multiple interactions occur between benthic herbivores and algae, and, as shown here, some of them are positive and involve modifications of the nutrient environment.",OECOLOGIA,86,2,,287,291,,10.1007/BF00317542,,,,,,0029-8549,,WOS:A1991FG40800018

Benthic invertebrates overview","The Arc river's hydrographic system is situated in a heavily urbanised and industrialized area where agriculture nevertheless still plays an important role. This paper presents an overall view of the water quality and the benthic populations based on a multivariate analysis of an annual cycle (18 physico-chemical parameters, 17 study sites : 9 on the river's main course, 8 on its tributaries). The resultant hydrochemical states are arranged in order of an eutrophication gradient represented by the first principal component. The allogenic elements, which have a preponderant role in the hydrosystem's activity, cause man-made eutrophication which overshadows the river's natural eutrophication. Only a few unpolluted tributaries still remain close to their original state.The benthic populations of the Arc hydrographic network were studied through a correspondence analysis using 15 sampling points containing 151 taxa selected on the axial stream and its tributaries. The upstream stations can be characterized by the presence of lenitophilous species adapted to the transitory environment. Throughout most of the river's course, a high level of organic and chemical pollution has helped to proliferate saprobiont species. In the little or undisturbed tributaries, there is a population which can be basically categorized as a rhithron biocenotype containing species capable of recolonizing the course of the main river.",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,27,1,,75,85,,10.1051/limn/1991005,,,,,,0003-4088,,WOS:000208072800005

When flow ceases the stream dries to isolated pools which receive high summer inputs of Eucalyptus obliqua litter. Decomposition of this material in remnant pools causes extremely dark waters and depressed oxygen concentrations for up to 90 days.2. Only two fully aquatic insect species, Leptorussa darlingtoni and Lectrides varians (Trichoptera: Leptoceridae), persist under these conditions. Both utilize litter as food, but have different feeding strategies. The more abundant L. darlingtoni ingests organic and microbial material from leaf surfaces, whereas L. varians is a leaf shredder.3. Larval processing budgets based on laboratory and field experiments indicated that L. varians has a greater impact on litter decomposition rates than L. darlingtoni. However, because of low density, low oxygen concentrations in pools during summer, and rapid flushing of litter from pools once flow recommences, L. varians larvae process a small proportion of the total litter input.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,25,1,,117,129,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00478.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:A1991FA88500012

We compared aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition within and between habitats (pools and riffles) at four sites on two intermittent streams in Victoria, Australia during a drought year followed by a wetter year to see how different spatial and temporal scales influenced patterns of community structure detected by multivariate techniques of ordination and classification. We also examined the fit between faunal groups and 'flow phases' characterized by multivariate analyses of physicochemical variables in an earlier paper.2. Pools contained more taxa and individuals than riffles. At the more temporary site, there was considerable overlap between the faunal composition of pools and riffles, whereas habitat-specific assemblages consistently occurred at the more permanent sites. Most taxa were either tolerant, permanent stream forms able to persist in streams that dry briefly, or facultative species that occur in lotic or lentic habitats. Few species appeared specifically adapted to temporary waters.3. Within habitats, there were some matches between faunal groups and flow phases, especially with the onset of the 'diminishing flow' phase, characterized by rising water temperature and conductivity, and declining pH and dissolved oxygen. However, disjunctions among faunal groups were less marked than those between flow phases, and were absent at an intermediate scale when habitats were pooled within sites. At the broadest scale of analysis (within habitats between sites and years), historical events (e.g. whether pools upstream dried completely during the previous summer) apparently influenced community composition as much as site-specific abiotic differences.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,27,1,,99,121,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00527.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:A1992HQ36000010
Invertebrate,1992,"BOULTON, AJ; LAKE, PS","THE ECOLOGY OF 2 INTERMITTENT STREAMS IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA .3. TEMPORAL CHANGES IN FAUNAL COMPOSITION","1. Temporal changes in species richness, total abundance, and numbers of individuals in seven functional feeding groups were compared between pools and riffles at four sites on two intermittent streams in Victoria sampled during a drought year followed by a wetter year.2. Species richness increased steadily over time, peaking in the riffles just before flow ceased. Maximum species richness occurred in the pools shortly after flow stopped, implying emigration from the drying riffles. There were two peaks in total numbers, first in autumn when flow commenced and again in late summer as flow diminished. Generalist feeders (collector-gatherers and collector-scrapers) were usually abundant throughout the year. Scraper densities rose in late spring-early summer in conjunction with enhanced periphyton growth, whereas predator numbers steadily increased during the year, peaking in all habitats just before they dried.3. Several floods in spring significantly reduced species richness and total numbers of individuals but recovery to pre-flood levels was generally complete within 2 weeks. Although floods had little effect upon succession, as indicated by trajectories in ordination space, the dry period interrupted otherwise cyclical sequences, consistently resulting in arch-shaped trajectories. Faunal change appeared to be allogenic, driven by the seasonal cycle of environmental phases.4. A group of early colonists or 'pioneer' species was replaced after several weeks by heterogeneous groups of 'mid-successional' taxa responsible for differences in faunal composition between riffles and pools. When flow diminished, these groups were replaced by 'summer' species, apparently capable of tolerating deteriorating environmental conditions, and potentially intensifying biotic interactions.5. We suggest that the cyclical temporal changes in assemblage composition observed in this study represent 'seasonal periodicity', whereas recovery after unpredictable disturbances such as floods that temporarily disrupt the cycle fits the definition of 'succession'. Succession rate is a measure of resilience, recovering to the cyclical trajectory that would exist in the absence of disturbance. 'Lag effects' brought about by reduced recruitment during the drought were not evident until the following year, emphasizing the significance of historical events and the need for long-term studies to describe the ecology of intermittent streams adequately.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,27,1,,123,138,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00528.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:A1992HQ36000011

A consistent cycle of seasonal change in assemblage composition occurred each year, little altered by spates. Changes reflected variations in presence or absence rather than relative abundance of taxa. Seasonal patterns were confirmed by plotting temporal changes in densities of common taxa. Invertebrate abundance (mostly oligochaetes and mayflies) peaked in spring. ""Summer"" dominants included the gastropod Physella virgata and the caddisfly larva Cheumatopsyche arizonensis. Assemblage composition remained relatively consistent during spring over 3 yr when high discharge was prolonged, whereas there was a major change in autumn community structure between 1984 and 1986, probably reflecting low discharge during a drought in 1986. Drying apparently influenced assemblage composition more than spates, possibly by altering habitat availability and the intensity of biotic interactions as surface stream volume shrank.Assemblage resistance to disturbance by spates was variable. Similarly, resistance of individual common taxa varied within and among taxa, and like assemblage resistance, was not simply a function of spate magnitude or timing (season). Resilience was generally high. Succession rate (degree of change in assemblage composition) declined during succession in all but spring sequences, which displayed no consistent trend. The two summer sequences had highest initial succession rates (in first 30 d postspate), possibly reflecting higher water temperatures, and also exhibited late-successional increases in succession rate. Spatial variation in assemblage composition was uncorrelated with any physical variable measured.Factors known to influence ecosystem-level processes such as primary productivity (e.g., inorganic nitrogen flux, days since spate) also affected community-level aspects such as aquatic invertebrate assemblage composition in Sycamore Creek. Discharge and water temperature had lesser but detectable effects, and probably contributed to the marked seasonality in assemblage composition. Further comparisons of collective properties of ecosystems and communities within other biomes may identify ""common denominators"" that characterize responses to disturbance and environmental change. This will remove the different perceptions about stability we gain by using response variables that are assessed only at a community or ecosystem level.",ECOLOGY,73,6,,2192,2207,,10.2307/1941467,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:A1992KB84300021

Interstitial water mites formed a diverse assemblage whereas insects were species-poor relative to surface benthos. There was little faunal overlap between the composition of epigean and hyporheic communities. Most hyporheic taxa appeared to be detritivores. We recognized four biotopes that were physicochemically and biotically distinctive in desert streams: a shallow hyporheic biotope down to approximately 50 cm, a phreatic biotope between 50 cm and bedrock, a parafluvial biotope comprising saturated sediments lateral to the wetted channel, and a dry channel hyporheic biotope that exists temporarily after surface water has disappeared. The shallow hyporheic zone is relatively well-oxygenated, low in nutrients, physically unstable (due to floods and drying), and harbours most taxa. Nutrients are higher whereas oxygen levels are lower in the more stable phreatic zone where larger interstitial spaces and higher hydraulic conductivity allow amphipods, isopods, and bathynellaceans free movement. In the parafluvial zone, nutrient levels vary, the water is hypoxic, and only nematodes and bathynellaceans are common. When surface water dries, a subset of the shallow hyporheic assemblage dominated by the water mites Meramecia and Neomamersa, ostracods, ceratopogonid larvae, and nematodes occurs. These biotopes can be viewed as functional subunits of the desert stream ecosystem. The existence of a rich hyporheic biota indicates the importance of subsurface processes in desert streams, and may provide a valuable tool for biomonitoring groundwater pollution in arid zones.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,125,1,,37,61,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:A1992JG83900003

Although salinization is recognised as the greatest threat to water resources throughout Australia, little is known of its effect on the biota. This paper gives the first quantitative description of the macroinvertebrate fauna of a salinized river system in southwestern Australia.Two sites on an intermittent stream (Thirty-four Mile Brook) and two sites on a perennial river (Hotham River), above and below the confluence with the above tributary, were sampled on three occasions for benthic macroinvertebrates. Only 68 taxa were recorded in quantitative samples from the sites; a further 11 taxa were recorded in qualitative samples from these and two additional sites on the tributary. The river system shared several faunal elements with athalassic salt lakes across southern Australia. Crustaceans, particularly the amphipod Austrochiltonia subtenuis and several species of ostracods, were numerically dominant at all sites. In contrast to the benthic fauna of most lotic systems, insects formed only a small proportion of the individuals collected from the Hotham River. Chironomids were the dominant insect group, both in terms of the number of species and individuals, particularly at one of the tributary sites where species of Tanytarsus comprised almost half of the total number of individuals. Overall, the benthic fauna was characterised by very high densities and low richness, diversity and evenness. This is likely to be a direct consequence of the poor water quality of the system where high salinities, often greater than 3 g l-1, were recorded.Classification and ordination revealed major differences in community structure of the benthic fauna between the Hotham River and its tributary. This was attributed to differences in the physical nature of the two streams, particularly substrate characteristics and stream permanence, rather than differences in water quality. Temporal differences in community structure were also apparent, but were more obvious in the Hotham River than in the tributary.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,248,2,,143,160,,10.1007/BF00006082,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:A1992KJ42000006

Ambient fish densities had little effect on total macrobenthic densities and processes on lower trophic levels before intermittence. Fish modestly affected macroinvertebrate densities after intermittence, when surface exchange of prey was interrupted by sections of dry stream. Among substrata, fish influenced macroinvertebrates on bedrock, but not on stony, coarse substrata. Densities of two taxa were significantly affected by fish, and this significantly altered the relative abundance of functional feeding groups in enclosures on bedrock by increasing the proportion of invertebrate predators in fish treatments. Macroinvertebrate densities in microhabitats on both substrata were not affected by fish presence. Dense growths of the stalked diatom Cymbella generally covered microhabitats and added structural complexity, particularly to bedrock surfaces. Unobstructed, natural migration of prey in the large(40 m2) fencelike enclosures (versus containers), ample refuge space, and low natural densities of fish were important in minimizing fish effects in enclosures.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,49,11,,2322,2330,,,,,,,,0706-652X,,WOS:A1992KF38800013

Patterns are described for small-scale experimental studies using introduced or natural substrates, for large-scale observations of new or rewatered channels, for rivers recovering from pollution, and for unstable rivers with fluctuating discharge. Colonization depends on invertebrate mobility (drift, swimming, crawling, and flight), substrate texture and associated food supplies, competition, and predation. Epilithon-browsers and filter feeders can use the resources of smooth stones; gatherers colonize as fine detritus accumulates; grazers increase as periphyton becomes established; shredders and predators tend to be late arrivals. Propagules for colonization are made more available by asynchronous and aseasonal life cycles, long oviposition periods, and refuges in the streambed or neighbouring waterbodies. Species in frequently disturbed streams benefit from these characteristics. Although disturbance may be due to stochastic factors, recovery is not due to chance. Recurring ecological patterns among early colonizers suggest that knowledge of the hydrologic regime, food resources, and dominant taxa can be used to predict the overall resilience of a stream community.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,49,3,,617,628,,10.1139/f92-071,,,,,,0706-652X,,WOS:A1992HJ15000022
Biogeochemistry,1992,"PETERSON, CG; GRIMM, NB",TEMPORAL VARIATION IN ENRICHMENT EFFECTS DURING PERIPHYTON SUCCESSION IN A NITROGEN-LIMITED DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,"Periphyton succession was studied over 89 d in longitudinally adjacent reaches (a riffle and run) in Sycamore Creek, a spatially intermittent desert stream. Effects of nitrogen limitation were assessed by comparing algal development on clay saucers containing either nitrate-enriched or unenriched agar. We evaluated effects of grazing on periphyton accrual by amending agar in half the substrata from each enrichment condition with an insecticide (Malathion). Early successional (25-d) communities on unenriched substrata were dominated by Epithemia sorex, a diatom capable of N2 fixation; non-fixing diatoms dominated enriched communities. NO3-N enrichment increased algal diversity (H') and delayed late-successional dominance by Calothrix, a heterocystous cyanobacterium. Replacement of diatoms by cyanobacteria was likely facilitated by autogenic changes in nutrient and light conditions within the periphyton and temporal increases in water temperature.Three measures of algal biomass exhibited nearly linear increases in all treatments over the 3-mo study. Enrichment enhanced standing crops of chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) in both reaches, an effect most pronounced within the first 3-4 wk. Algal populations unable to fix N2 were stimulated by enrichment but remained in low abundance on unenriched substrata whereas biovolume of N2-fixing populations was lower on enriched substrata relative to controls.Malathion reduced the density of only one common grazer, the moth larva Petrophila jaliscalis, which was abundant only in the riffle. Addition of Malathion to enriched substrata in this habitat had no significant effect on net primary productivity or total algal biovolume but resulted in increased chlorophyll a and AFDM, suggesting that Petrophila did influence algal communities, but by a mechanism that remains unclear.Spatial heterogeneity of nutrient supply in this system contributes to maintenance of algal diversity; but over long successional series diversity declines regardless of enrichment owing to autogenic changes that occur during succession. Our results confirm earlier observations that low nitrogen availability limits accrual of algal biomass following spates and constrains algal community structure in Sycamore Creek. However, highly significant early successional differences in algal standing crop and community structure among enrichment treatments were eliminated or much reduced in mid to late stages of succession. We propose that this temporal change in enrichment response was caused by development of a thick periphyton mat that reduced availability of both water-column or substratum-derived nutrients to algae, and increased reliance on internal nutrient recycling.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,11,1,,20,36,,10.2307/1467879,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1992HJ00200003

We determined utilization levels of forage species over time as a fixed animal density decreased available forage as a means of approximating the stocking rate suitable for an area and identifying plant species for monitoring. Trend in abundance of important plant species will ultimately determine appropriate stocking rate in a particular management situation.Forage utilization by cattle during mid-summer for 2 successive years was measured weekly for 3 weeks in streamside (channel and floodplain) and adjacent upland (terrace and saline upland) vegetation communities along the ephemeral stream. Measures were also made of crude protein and dry matter content of plant species. Plant communities used by cattle were also recorded.Utilization of streamside and terrace vegetation declined markedly over the 3 weeks, while utilization of forage in saline uplands was lower than in other areas and did not decline over weeks of study. More cattle selected streamside and terrace areas with the most succulent forages than saline uplands with less succulent forages. Woody plants in channel areas, cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh.) particularly, were higher in protein, more succulent, and more severely grazed than other species. Management of cottonwood probably limits the stocking rate used in these communities. Declines in weekly utilization of forages after the first week indicated intake may have been declining. If so, lower levels of utilization may be needed to maintain animal performance. Maintenance of cottonwoods and animal performance considerations may dictate a lower stocking rate than achieved in this midsummer study.",JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,45,4,,391,395,,10.2307/4003089,,,,,,0022-409X,,WOS:A1992JD60800013

Observations included activity and habitat where it occurred. Concomitantly, utilization levels, protein content, and dry matter content of forages were determined in the small pastures.A higher percent of cattle selected channel and floodplain habitats than percent area of habitats while a lower percent of cattle selected upland habitat than percent of this habitat in the area. Utilization levels of forages except greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus (Hook.) Torrey) in the floodplain were not greatly different among habitats. Protein and dry matter content of forages did not vary greatly among habitats, except greasewood had higher protein and lower dry matter than other species and received much higher use. Forage quality declined in summer and fall. Animal preference for channel habitat was attributed to more available forage in the channels. In contrast, selection of floodplains was due to succulence and high protein content of greasewood.

We examined four diallelic gene loci (Ldh-1, Idh-2, Pgd, and Ck-A) in P. monacha and tested whether genotypes were associated with differential survival of individuals exposed to acute stress. For each locus, the common allele was associated with higher survival during heat and hypoxic stress, whereas the alternate allele was associated with higher survival during cold stress. In most cases, survival of heterozygotes was intermediate and they exhibited less variance in survival than corresponding homozygotes. Identification of substantial linkage disequilibrium in these fish confounds our ability to discern whether the allozymes are the direct targets of selection, or if they just mark chromosomal regions that contain the true modifiers of survival.

Fish,1992,"WINEMILLER, KO; LESLIE, MA","FISH ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS A COMPLEX, TROPICAL FRESH-WATER MARINE ECOTONE","Riverine fish assemblages in the temperate zone generally show strong longitudinal patterns of faunal turnover and increases in species richness with increasing stream order. We examined the composition and structure of tropical fish assemblages across a complex freshwater/marine ecotone in Tortuguero National Park on the Caribbean coast of Central America. Species turnover was high between four characteristic habitats that largely corresponded with a longitudinal gradient of stream order over distances of less than 30 km. Suites of common fish species characterized each habitat: creeks, rivers, lagoons, and the sea. In addition to the habitat endemics, several species spanned two habitat types, but only three species were collected in more than two habitats. Multivariate gradient analysis of fish assemblages reflected a gradient of habitats that to some extent corresponded to fluvial distances. Due to the unusual configuration of coastal lagoons lying parallel to the coast, the ordination gradient showed little correlation with linear distance to the coast. Environmental variables related to habitat size and salinity showed greatest correspondence with the fish assemblage ordination gradient. Invertebrate-feeding fishes were the predominant trophic group in 15 of 16 fish assemblages, and inland creek sites contained a greater proportion of herbivores and omnivores than other sites. The relative fraction of herbivorous and detritivorous fishes showed a monotonic decline along the longitudinal habitat gradient from inland to coast. Patterns of species composition and richness at Tortuguero Park appeared to agree well with earlier models of factors influencing temperate zone stream fishes. Headwaters have low aquatic primary productivity and contain small colonizing fish species subject to large fluctuations in local densities and intermittent competition. Lagoons contain both large and small species, the latter being restricted largely to shallow edge habitats by predation. Lagoons exhibit more lentic environmental conditions, experience relatively fewer periodic disturbances than headwaters, and their assemblages are inferred to be under relatively greater influence of biotic factors. Fish assemblages of rivers and canos (swampy side channels and braids) appear to be under less abiotic control than headwaters and influenced less by biotic factors than lagoons.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,34,1,,29,50,,10.1007/BF00004783,,,,,,0378-1909,,WOS:A1992HY87100002

Surface water downwelled at the terminus, and physicochemical conditions in the hyporheic zone at 30 cm resembled those in the stream above. With increasing distance beyond the terminus and presumably greater hyporheic residence time, diel fluctuations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen became dampened, and were absent 80 m beyond the terminus. At least 31 taxa were collected, 19 of which were surface species temporarily occupying the hyporheic zone. These epigean taxa commonly occurred as tiny instars in the hyporheos below the stream in regions of strong downwelling. Further downstream, the hyporheos became dominated by phreatic species (e.g. blind amphipods, syncarids) that are obligate subsurface residents. At the most downstream site, where dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest and water temperatures highest, species richness was least, although biomass (mainly amphipods) was greatest. There was no diel variation in assemblage composition, species richness, total abundance and biomass, or the abundance of common species at any of the sites below the stream. The longitudinal pattern in the spatial distribution of the hyporheos appeared to be related to stream hydrology (downwelling), bed permeability, and the hyporheic residence time of the water.",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,44,3,,411,426,,,,,,,,0067-1940,,WOS:A1993LW86600004

Diel and seasonal temperature differences are extreme and the average rainfall is 250 mm per annum. The streams of the Range are the largest group within the Central Ranges and are relatively pristine. Their flow regimes are episodic but deep rock pools appear to act as reservoirs of surface runoff and may also receive groundwater from the Mereenie aquifer.The waterbodies of the Range and some nearby areas were sampled in July and December 1986 to determine the composition of the macroinvertebrate communities and biogeographical relationships with the fauna of lotic systems elsewhere in Australia. Macroinvertebrate species richness at the Range was comparable with that of other Australian streams but no Plecoptera, Isopoda or Amphipoda were collected. The almost complete absence of shredders may reflect low allochthonous inputs, because riparian vegetation in the arid zone is generally sparse. A small proportion of the fauna of the Range appears to be a relictual stream fauna. Species of low vagility such as the waterpenny, Sclerocyphon fuscus, would not be capable of dispersal across the large tracts of arid land that now separate the Range from southern Australia, where it is also found. The occurrence of new species at the Range suggests that it is also a site of allopatric speciation within some groups.

Numerous small projects have demonstrated that vegetation can be restored, sediment losses halted, and, in some cases, formerly ephemeral streams made perennial. But if all watersheds in a basin were restored, what would be the overall effects both ecologically and economically? For example, if large-scale restoration of small watersheds were conducted in a western river basin, what would be the effects on water yield and quality for the basin as a whole? Would implementing basin-wide watershed restoration be cost-effective? A means of examining this question is to monitor a watershed prior to and during the restoration process and to compare the results to a control watershed. The watersheds would be instrumented such that the ecological processes and water balance could be monitored both instream and within the associated groundwater system. Overall effects would then be subjected to economic and policy analysis, and modeling would be used to extrapolate the new information over the entire basin. These results would then be available to political leaders and government agencies for determining whether large-scale watershed restoration should be public policy.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,17,6,,729,734,,10.1007/BF02393893,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:A1993MA40500002

In floodplains, perennial grasses were not responsive to grazing; annual grasses were twice as abundant in grazed pastures. Vegetation standing crop in uplands was not influenced by grazing. Over the study period in all pastures, standing crop of blue grams (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths) declined 4 fold while cool-season grasses increased 5 fold. Shrub density did not increase as much in grazed as in ungrazed pastures. Root biomass of the channel decreased 23% in years with less precipitation but was greater by 24% on concave than convex bank types. Location on channels influenced root biomass but grazing did not.

We illustrate this relationship using two case studies from very different lotic ecosystems: a large mesic river in France and an intermittent desert stream in Arizona. In both cases, there are strong correlations between direction and magnitude of hydrologic fluxes and the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages. Hydrologists are likely to find that the distribution and abundance of hyporheos will provide useful corroborative data in studies of hyporheic flow dynamics, while ecologists should recognize the effects of hydrologic exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone at a variety of scales. Thus hydrologic measurements of surface water and ground-water exchange should be included routinely in future studies of hyporheic invertebrate ecology.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) was reduced in the interstitial environment (<50% saturation), but hyporheic water was enriched in nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Time-of-day and location of wells interacted significantly to produce distinct patterns of diel variation in NO3-N and SRP in wells located beneath the wetted perimeter. In lateral wells, NO3-N concentration showed significant spatial variation, but exhibited no significant variation among sampling times within a day. Vertical hydraulic gradient varied from +0.29 to -0.84 over a 90 m study reach and hydraulic heads varied by as much as 9 cm on a diel basis. Concentration and flux of NO3-N was greatest in surface water overlying upwelling regions at night when upwelling heads were greatest.

During April (low flow), feeding rates were relatively low and aperiodic, whereas in September (high flow), the fish were clearly feeding diurnally at a relatively high rate. These results suggest that feeding in G. olidus in intermittent streams may vary on a daily and seasonal basis, possibly as a consequence of changes in light availability and stream flow. Light determines the ability of fish to find their prey, and seasonal changes in flow may determine the availability of prey (i.e. drifting invertebrates). This pattern suggests that the predatory impact of drift-feeding fish, such as G. olidus, is likely to be considerably less during low-flow periods when drifting invertebrates are not available than during high-flow periods when such prey may be abundant.",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,45,2,,227,232,,,,,,,,0067-1940,,WOS:A1994NB96000010

Analysis of arc symmetry and the repetition of symmetry indicate that the 153 bends along the 39.3 km long river are not true meanders as objectively defined by Brice in 1964. The dominant factor controlling the degree of sinuosity is channel bank resistance to lateral erosion as influenced primarily by the nature of riparian vegetation and secondarily by the percentage silt/clay in channel bank sediment. The influence of bank vegetation is particularly pronounced in view of the preponderance of low flow discharges, high proportion of suspended sediment and gentle bed slope. The high density of riparian trees account for the relatively short length of the straight reaches and the high frequency of bends, compound and convoluted loops. The implications for river management of the inherent instability of small channels in seasonally wet humid tropical environments, and of the considerable channel bank erosion which occurs at the numerous bends are briefly highlighted.",CATENA,21,1,,13,25,,10.1016/0341-8162(94)90028-0,,,,,,0341-8162,,WOS:A1994NE73300002

At one stream, located in the Andean piedmont, invertebrate densities displayed large fluctuations and between-month variation differed by as many as four orders of magnitude. Major declines in invertebrate numbers were generally associated with frequent disasters, defined as channel-shifting spates and drought.3. At the other stream, a montane site located at higher elevation, invertebrate densities varied by little more than an order of magnitude over the duration of the study. Reductions in invertebrate numbers between successive months generally occurred during the rainy season.4. Monthly invertebrate densities were inversely related to rainfall at each site. In addition, a highly significant positive relationship was observed between invertebrate density and the number of days elapsed since the previous major rainstorm event. Relationships between rainfall and invertebrate densities differed between streams, however, with significantly steeper regression slopes being found at the piedmont than the montane site.5.

Water samples were analyzed for nitrate-N, ammonium-N, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. Nitrate-N concentration increased along parafluvial flowpaths, with the largest increases occurring in summer. Although ammonium-N concentration was low and did not vary with season or location on flowpath, dissolved oxygen declined as water moved through parafluvial gravel bars. Net nitrification rate was highest in the summer and at the heads of flowpaths where surface water entered the parafluvial zone, suggesting that nitrification may be dependent upon ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen, or particulate organic nitrogen imported from the surface stream.

The size, abundance and availability of drifting invertebrates influenced red roach feeding. When drift was scarce or inaccessible, both age groups fed on detritus, plants, or a combination of the two.

During predictable winter and spring spates, sand substrata underwent regular scouring, causing large seasonal declines in macroinvertebrate species richness and numbers of individuals and marked changes in community structure. These regular short-term seasonal disturbances may be termed pulse disturbances, and their effects were most severe at mid-reach sites where sand deposits were most recent. At these sites, the press disturbance of increased sand storage also rendered the stream bed more susceptible to pulse disturbances. When winter and spring scouring spates ceased, stable communities of macroinvertebrates developed. At sampling sites on lower reaches, where the sand had yet to reach, there was little seasonal change in macroinvertebrate community structure or numbers of individuals. Seasonal variation in benthic species richness at these structurally heterogeneous sites was due to changes in the numbers of less abundant species associated with macrophytes.

No community changes were detected at a second site which remained connected with upstream reaches by surface flow. Mortality after water loss was severe as few individuals survived longer than 10 days. Low resistance during the dry phase was associated with rapid moisture loss from sediments. Invertebrate persistence in intermittent reaches was due to recolonization after rewetting; however, density increases after floods which reestablished flow at dry sites were lower than reported values for perennial sites in Sycamore Creek.

FAUNAL DYNAMICS,"Spatial and temporal changes in assemblage structure of the hyporheos of a Sonoran Desert stream were monitored after re-wetting occurred in winter at three sites with different flow regimens. Diverse assemblages of hyporheic invertebrates were found at all sites within two days of re-wetting. At two sites, drying represented a gradual press disturbance to the hyporheos, altering the assemblage composition from a predominance of cyclopoid copepods and chironomids to one dominated by microturbellarians, ceratopogonid larvae, ostracods, nematodes, and, just before the hyporheic zone dried, several species of water mites. There were fewest hyporheic taxa at the most intermittent site where cyclopoid copepods were most numerous. The site that remained inundated during the entire study harbored a speciose hyporheos whose composition varied vertically and laterally. Amphipods, isopods, and bathynellaceans were found in the ''phreatic'' (deeper than 50 cm) zone whereas cyclopoids, cladocerans, chironomids, and water mites were common in the ''shallow'' (< 50 cm) hyporheic habitat. In wells sunk in the stream bank, nematodes, ostracods, and bathynellaceans characterized the ''parafluvial'' zone. Spates temporarily altered the assemblage composition of the parafluvial and shallow hyporheic habitats but recovery was rapid, implying a resilient fauna. Phreatic assemblages were not immediately influenced by spates. At the scale of an individual reach (122 m), a distinct longitudinal pattern in assemblage composition was correlated with trends in water chemistry and the gradual transition from zones of hyporheic upwelling (discharge) to downwelling (recharge). Upwelling areas were nitrate-rich, hypoxic, and harbored a typically ''phreatic'' fauna whereas downwelling zones were well-oxygenated, low in nitrate, and were characterized by taxa found in the shallow hyporheos. This longitudinal pattern was consistent over time but became truncated as surface water receded upstream, altering the exchange of surface and subsurface water. Recognition of temporal changes in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal variation in subsurface biota and how they respond to surficial hydrologic extremes is essential to understanding the way these subsystems interact with the surface stream ecosystem; the next goal is to determine the causes of these patterns.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,134,1,,27,52,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:A1995RJ33500002

There were significant among-pool differences in the prevalence of the three parasites. There was no evidence to suggest that clinostomatid or 'diplostomulum' prevalence was influenced by the position of pools within the downstream gradient; however,'neascus' prevalence tended to decrease with distance downstream. Host length accounted for some of the variation in parasite prevalence among pools for both diplostomulids. Prevalence and intensity of a clinostomid in the body cavity varied with host gender and body size. There was a positive relationship between body size and clinostomatid parasitization in female hosts. Most males examined were less than 50 mm (total length). For fish less than 50 mm, males were more parasitized than females. Prevalence of the two diplostomulids was not related to the relative net periphyton production or the dissolved oxygen concentration of the pools.

Instream distance explained up to 68% of observed genetic variation; distance effects were modified by barriers that allowed only downstream movement during peak flooding. Different alleles occurred at high frequencies in the headwaters of each catchment. Predominance of a single allele in headwater populations was attributed to absence of upstream movement and the ephemeral nature of headwater populations. Headwater alleles were the most common alleles in lower reach populations, Intercatchment differences were attributed to random fixation of different alleles in headwater populations, followed by dispersal of alleles downstream during peak flood events. Multiple alleles were maintained in lower reach populations by immigration from tributaries where alternative alleles presumably had drifted to high frequencies. Differentiation among lower reach populations fluctuated annually as a function of immigration entering lower sites from alternative upstream sources. Immigration from source populations was related to flow velocity in tributaries converging above lower sites, Allele frequency changes associated with saltwater inundations maintained genetic differences among lower reach populations during periods of low flow and isolation.

For this region periodic droughts, with the accompanying disappearance of lakes and some parts of rivers, are typical. Two forms of a Cyprinid species Oreoleuciscus humilis (dwarf Altai osman) occur in this region during wet periods which usually last for 10-30 years. The dwarf form, is characterized by a maximum SL of 200 mm and early maturation (SL = 70 mm, four years of age). It inhabits small desert rivers in dry periods which last for 3-5 years and both rivers and the riparian zone of lakes during wet periods. The larger lake form occurs only in lakes during the wet periods. It can attain a maximum size of 450 mm and matures in six years, SL = 200 mm. These two forms of O. humilis differ in feeding habits, rates of growth, and morphology. The dwarf form feeds mainly on insect larvae and on plants. The lake form consumes the same food items until it reaches 180 mm SL and then becomes piscivorous. Populations of O. humilis in lakes are restored after a dry period, originating anew from river populations of the dwarf form.Currently there is a transition from a dry period to a wet one. Orog-Nur (one of the lakes of Lake Valley) has been filling with water since 1990. In July 1991 the depth of this lake reached 0.5-1.0 m and fish were found in the lake. The large individuals of dwarf form which came to the lake from the Tuyn-Gol River became cannibals, and their growth rate increased rapidly.

Experimental manipulations were performed to determine the biological, chemical and physical attributes that govern sediment respiration in the hyporheic zone of Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream.2. Hyporheic respiration per unit volume of sediment was inversely related to diameter of sediment particles, indicating that respiration is affected by availability of substrate for microbial colonization (i.e. sediment surfaces). Respiration rate per unit surface area on sediments was positively correlated with particle diameter, indicating greater metabolic activity of microbes on larger sediments.3. Hyporheic respiration was more than twice as high in water collected from the surface flow than from subsurface flow. Further, hyporheic respiration was highest immediately following exposure of sediments to surface water and declined over time, presumably due to exhaustion of labile organic matter.4. Microbial activity was stimulated by addition of algal leachate; however, amendments of leaf leachate had little effect. Respiration was also elevated with dextrose and leucine amendments, but not with inorganic nitrogen additions, indicating hyporheic respiration is carbon limited.5. Water from the stream surface is probably enriched in labile organic matter derived from algae and stimulates respiration at points of hydrologic downwelling where surface water enters hyporheic sediments. The physical structure of sediments further affects metabolism by affecting the area available for microbial attachment.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,34,1,,91,99,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00426.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:A1995RP65400010

Two alternative hypotheses were specifically addressed: (1) organic matter derived from the surface stream supports hyporheic respiration, and (2) detritus buried during flash floods supports hyporheic respiration. As predicted for the surface-derived organic matter hypothesis, respiration was lowest immediately following flash floods and increased significantly with time after flood (P < 0.001). Hyporheic respiration ranged from 0.05 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following a flash flood to as high as 4.41 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in algal succession. Respiration was significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during two spring/summer successional sequences (P < 0.05; partial correlation coefficients 0.58 and 0.88).

Nitrification was significantly correlated with hyporheic respiration, supporting the hypothesis that nitrification is fueled by mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium.

Canarian endemism and a Mediterranean origin are dominant features in the data set. At least 14 species are Tenerife endemics. Endemism is especially high in the Diptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera.2. Extensive investigations were carried out at 57 sites in six different habitat categories and from at least two seasons. The most species-rich habitats were those with permanently running water, a biotope that is rare and diminishing in Tenerife.3. The principal threat to freshwater environments is an increase in human exploitation of the water resources, which, if it is not moderated, will cause extinctions in the near future. Taxa that do not favour man-made canals are especially at risk-a risk that is increased by the small number of populations. These include the Canarian endemics Wormaldia tagananana, Tinodes canariensis (Trichoptera), Dixa tetrica (Diptera) and Baetis pseudorhodani (Ephemeroptera). Thirty-nine species were found at five or fewer sites.4. Some species can survive in intermittent streams, although we found less than half of the taxa present in this habitat, indicating the extent of the diversity reductions that might be expected to follow the drying up of permanent streams.5. Species living in the thin film of water in the madicolous habitats are similarly at risk. Three Canarian endemics were found exclusively in this habitat: Hydrotarsus pilosus, Limnebius punctatus (Coleoptera) and Satchelliella binunciolata (Diptera).6.

Analysis of this protein family in individuals from an outbred population of tropical topminnows, Poeciliopsis gracilis, showed that while constitutive hsp70 family members showed no variation in protein isoforms, inducibly synthesized hsp70 was polymorphic. Several species of Poeciliopsis adapted to desert environments exhibited lower levels of inducible hsp70 polymorphism than the tropical species, but constitutive forms were identical to those in P. gracilis, as they were in the confamilial species Gambusia affinis. These differences suggest that inducible and constitutive members of this family are under different evolutionary constraints and may indicate differences in their function within the cell. Also, northern desert species of Poeciliopsis synthesize a subset of the inducible hsp70 isoforms seen in tropical species. This distribution supports the theory that ancestral tropical fish migrated northward and colonized desert streams; the subsequent decrease in variation of inducible hsp70 may have been due to genetic drift or a consequence of adaptation to the desert environment. Higher levels of variability were found when the 30-kilodalton heat shock protein (hsp30) family was analyzed within different strains of two desert species of Poeciliopsis and also in wild-caught individuals of Gambusia affinis.

Assessment,1995,"ONDIEKI, CM",FIELD ASSESSMENT OF FLOOD EVENT SUSPENDED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT FROM EPHEMERAL STREAMS IN THE TROPICAL SEMIARID CATCHMENTS,"An assessment of suspended sediment transport was carried out in a number of semiarid catchments during flood events in order to quantify the degradation rates. In order to quantify these, a systematic sampling procedure of the episodic flood events was proposed for representative catchments. The procedure allows for an integration over the whole run-off episode using both the rising and falling limbs of the run-off hydrograph to compute the sediment quantities for each individual hood event.Higher sediment concentrations occurred in the rising limb than those at the recession for any stage of flow. The maximum suspended sediment concentration was observed at the peak of the flood hydrograph. An integration of the sediment concentration over its duration gave the total sediment yield from the flood event. For the ephemeral channels, only a small number of food events were observed over a three-year experimental period each with a duration of the order of 3-6 h. It is notable that high sediment loads were associated with high flow volumes which were effectively the result of the catchment characteristics and incident rainfall causing the hood events in the respective catchments, A large percentage of the annual sediment yield from a catchment is transported by the ephemeral streams during a small number of hood events. The correct determination of the total sediment yield from any of the hood events depends entirely on the accuracy of the measurements.The understanding of run-off and sediment loss for the representative catchments aims at assisting planning, management and control of water and land resources for sustainable development in the semi-arid parts of the tropics. The sediment rates reveal the degradation of catchments which have repercussions on the crop and pasture production and this has a bearing on the soil and water conservation programmes in the delicate ecological balance of the semi-arid areas. Further, these rates will determine the lifespan of the reservoirs planned for the dry river valleys (ephemeral streams) and existing ones which serve livestock and domestic needs. These occasionally will require costly rehabilitation and scooping to increase effective storage unless conservation measures are taken, and these measures are bound to vary from place to place as per the representative catchments output.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,35,1,,43,54,,,,,,,,0167-6369,,WOS:A1995QV72500004

Biogeochemistry,1995,"STANLEY, EH; BOULTON, AJ",HYPORHEIC PROCESSES DURING FLOODING AND DRYING IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM .1. HYDROLOGIC AND CHEMICAL-DYNAMICS,"We examined the effects of flooding and prolonged drying on interstitial water chemistry in the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream at three sites with different flow regimens. Sampling began immediately after a winter flood rewetted the previously dry stream, and ended when a summer flash flood destroyed many sampling wells 170 days later. Nitrate-N, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved oxygen concentrations were high whereas ammonium-N was low at all sites at the beginning of the study period. As discharge declined and drying began, nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentrations declined in phreatic (> 50 cm deep) and parafluvial (lateral to the active channel) subsystems while shallow hyporheic (< 50 cm) samples remained well-oxygenated. Hyporheic water chemistry in areas lacking surface flow (the dry channel hyporheic) varied between sites; nitrate-N and dissolved oxygen decreased at one site but increased at another. With continued drying, phreatic and parafluvial habitats became extremely hypoxic (< 0.50 mg/L dissolved oxygen) and low in nitrate-N (< 0.02 mg/L) due to reduced hydrologic exchange between surface and hyporheic waters. The increased area of hypoxia apparently enhanced nitrate-reducing transformations in phreatic and parafluvial habitats because interstitial nitrate-N concentrations often were lower than surface values; thus, drying caused a functional shift in this N-limited stream as the hyporheic zone changed from a nitrate source to a nitrate sink. Boundaries of hyporheic subsystems fluctuated considerably in response to flooding and drying, underscoring the importance of hydrologic extremes to the strength of chemical linkages between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,134,1,,1,26,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:A1995RJ33500001

This would facilitate comparisons between the large rivers of humid climates, where flow regimes are comparatively regular, and those of arid and semi-arid areas, where river regimes are highly variable. Ecosystem processes might be modelled by combining the river continuum and flood pulse concepts, with refinements to accommodate a complex flood pulse (e.g. variations in stage amplitude, timing, duration, rates of rise and fail). Patch boundaries (ecotones) such as the riverine littoral zone warrant close study because they strongly influence the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem. The general model needs a quantitative basis, perhaps focused on the balance of processes involved in the physical transport and biological transformation of carbon. The ultimate test of such a model will be in its capacity to predict the effects of flow regulation. Further development, however, is limited by data. In both research and management monitoring programmes need to be established to provide information and to develop a sustained, comprehensive approach to dryland rivers as ecosystems.",REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,11,1,,85,104,,10.1002/rrr.3450110108,,International Conference on Sustaining the Ecological Integrity of Large Floodplain Rivers - Application of Ecological Knowledge to River Management,"JUL 12-15, 1994","Natl Biol Serv, Environm Management Tech Ctr","LA CROSSE, WI",0886-9375,,WOS:A1995RY77300007

For channels experiencing fluvial-type flows, the Darcy-Weisbach technique is appropriate. For channels experiencing debris flows, a technique based on flow tilt around bends can be applied. When used to estimate downstream changes in discharge of piedmont streams in the Tunisian Southern Atlas, the effects of transmission losses are clearly evident. Debris flow channels exhibit a more rapid loss of discharge, with flow confined to the proximal zone of the piedmont.

We assessed the response of hyporheic invertebrates to drying by sampling 5 sets of wells (30, 50, and 100 cm deep) from 8 May 1995 to 4 August 1995 in an intermittent desert stream undergoing drying. Drying began with discontinuity of surface water, and continued through loss of surface now to recession of the water table (at a rate of 11 cm/wk) to >1 m depth by August. Twenty taxa were collected during the study. Shallow (30- and 50-cm) assemblages consisted mainly of insect larvae and cyclopoid copepods whereas bathynellaceans, isopods, and harpacticoid copepods were the major taxa in deeper (100-cm) sediments. Total abundance of all taxa combined and abundance of many individual taxa differed between depths, but also changed significantly over time. The interaction between date and depth was also significant, indicating that the direction of temporal change was not consistent among well depths. Once surface-water dried, total invertebrate abundance began to increase in wells that remained inundated. Thereafter, as the water table continued to recede, abundance in the 100-cm wells increased while numbers in shallow wells decreased. This pattern supports the hypothesis that the hyporheos migrates into deeper sediments to avoid conditions associated with drying.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,15,4,,700,712,,10.2307/1467817,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1996WC65800024

Twenty G. olidus, a key generalist predator in the system studied, were enclosed for 3 weeks in 1.5 x 1.7 m enclosures. Galaxias olidus was found to reduce significantly the distribution and abundance of air-breathing nektonic species. In contrast, the abundance of non-air-breathing nektonic species increased in the presence of fish in the deep areas of the enclosures. There was no significant impact of fish predation on species richness, total abundance, epibenthic or interstitial species. The most likely reason for the general lack of response to the presence of fish by epibenthic and interstitial species is the availability of abundant spatial refugia from predation within the complex substrate of the stream. In contrast, air-breathing nektonic species are vulnerable to predation by fish due to the lack of refuges in the open water. Increases in the abundance of non-air-breathing nektonic species in the presence of fish may be related to reductions in the abundance of predatory dytiscid beetles. Significant differences between deep and shallow habitats were observed in total abundance and species richness, and in the abundances of air-breathing nektonic and epibenthic species, suggesting that physicochemical factors play a key role in determining invertebrate distribution within stream pools.",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,21,2,,217,223,,,,,,,,0307-692X,,WOS:A1996UX37800009

Over the four successive summers of the study, the distribution of S. trutta expanded upstream. Coincident with the expansion of S. trutta was a contraction in the distribution of G. Olidus upstream. In the summer of 1988, an extended dry spell resulted in high levels of S. trutta mortality at the upstream limits of their distribution. This suggested that the upstream distribution of S. trutta could ultimately be constrained by an inability to tolerate prolonged periods of low stream flow and high temperatures that tended to occur in the headwaters of the stream. A study of summer mortality was conducted over three successive summers (1989-1991) at three reaches along the river. The two downstream reaches contained only S. trutta, the upstream reach contained both S. trutta and G. olidus. Salmo trutta mortality was consistently higher at the most up stream reach compared with lower reaches. High levels of S. trutta mortality at the two downstream reaches were only observed in 1991, a particularly dry year. In contrast, G. olidus survived in scattered small pools throughout the upper reaches of the stream. The results of the study suggest a shifting pattern of S. trutta and G. olidus distribution determined by the duration of low stream flow periods and summer high temperatures.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,47,1,,17,26,,10.1007/BF00002376,,,,,,0378-1909,,WOS:A1996VB08200002

The usefulness of the ordination method canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the classification method cluster analysis (UPGMA) were examined to evaluate the perturbation, Macroinvertebrate samples were segregated along the first ordination axis by CCA, which in turn correlated with sulphates and nitrates. CCA produced a two-dimensional distribution of sites similar to the grouping formed by cluster analysis. In general, three or four groups were distinguished. Immediately downstream of the effluent discharge point, only taxa tolerant to law oxygen, high pH and high sulphate and nitrate concentrations were present. Further downstream, sites had a community similar to the reference sampling locations. During flowing conditions the CCA ordination axis I was also correlated with several classic measures of water quality (i.e. taxon richness, diversity and biotic indices). In other periods, only the percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and the ratio EPT/(Chironomidae + EPT) were significantly correlated with CCA axis one.

Additional experiments were conducted to establish the influence of light and water velocity on primary production rates and recovery of biomass following dry periods. The study period encompassed two extreme (> 50 year calculated return time) floods, thus we were able to analyze the effects of scour on periphyton biomass and productivity. Biomass of sedimentary algae was reduced greatly by flooding and did not reach preflood amounts during the 2 months following the first flood. Rates of primary production associated with sediments recovered to levels above preflood rates within 2 weeks. Biomass of epilithic periphyton was not affected as severely as that of sedimentary algae. Little relationship was observed between water velocity and photosythetic rates. Production reached maximum rates at 25% of full sun light. Epilithic chlorophyll levels recovered within eight days following a dry period, and chi a was an order of magnitude greater on rocks than sediments 51 days after re-wetting.

Invertebrate,1996,"Feminella, JW",Comparison of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in small streams along a gradient of flow permanence,"Benthic invertebrates were quantified in 6 small upland streams in Alabama for 2 y to examine the degree to which variation in assemblage structure was related to the hydrologic permanence of riffle habitats. Streams differed along a gradient of flow permanence: 2 were normally intermittent (i.e., riffles ceased flowing in normal rainfall years) in summer, 1 was rarely intermittent (i.e., normally perennial), and 3 streams were occasionally intermittent (i.e., riffles ceased flowing during dry years). Despite large differences in flow permanence among streams, invertebrate assemblages differed only slightly. Presence-absence data revealed that 75% of the species (171 total taxa, predominantly aquatic insects) were ubiquitous across the 6 streams or displayed no pattern with respect to permanence; 7% of the total species were found exclusively in the normally intermittent streams. Although somewhat variable, many of the community richness and diversity measures were positively correlated with stream permanence. Year-to-year differences in assemblages within single streams appeared as great as differences between streams of contrasting permanence within a given year. Faunal similarity among streams was higher in 1995, a year with normal summer rainfall that followed a wet year (1994), than in 1994, a wet year that followed a dry year. Between-year differences in density and richness were lowest in spring and winter and greatest in summer, the season when communities were directly exposed to drying of riffles in intermittent streams. Several populations of common invertebrates during summer displayed non-random distributions along the permanence gradient. These data in general support the hypotheses that 1) benthic invertebrate assemblages show predictable, albeit subtle, relationships with stream permanence, and 2) antecedent hydrologic conditions associated with riffle permanence, perhaps because of their effects on survival and recruitment of subsequent generations, can influence the structure of benthic assemblages in streams.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,15,4,,651,669,,10.2307/1467814,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1996WC65800021

We used three variations of the acetylene block technique to estimate denitrification rates, and compared these estimates to rates of nitrate production through nitrification. Subsurface sediments of Sycamore Creek are typically well-oxygenated, relatively low in nitrate, and low in organic carbon, and therefore are seemingly unlikely sites of denitrification. However, we found that denitrification potential (C & N amended, anaerobic incubations) was substantial, and even by our conservative estimates (unamended, oxic incubations and field chamber nitrous oxide accumulation), denitrification consumed 5-40% of nitrate produced by nitrification. We expected that denitrification would increase along hyporheic and parafluvial flowpaths as dissolved oxygen declined and nitrate increased. To the contrary, we found that denitrification was generally highest at the upstream ends of subsurface flowpaths where surface water had just entered the subsurface zone. This suggests that denitrifiers may be dependent on the import of surface-derived organic matter, resulting in highest denitrification rate at locations of surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange. Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification in Sycamore Creek sediments was primarily nitrogen limited and secondarily carbon limited, and was temperature dependent. Overall, the quantity of nitrate removed from the Sycamore Creek ecosystem via denitrification is significant given the nitrogen-limited status of this stream.",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,33,2,,125,146,,10.1007/BF02181035,,,,,,0168-2563,,WOS:A1996UT83200003

In 1989 and 1990, the years of lowest stream discharge (0.08 and 0.04 m(3) s(-1) annual mean of daily discharge, respectively), DOC was high, averaging 7.37 and 6.22 mgC l(-1) (weighted annual means).

Concentration exhibited little spatial variation between two sampling stations located 6 km apart along the mainstem or between surface and hyporheic waters. Annual export of DOC from Sycamore Creek varied 100-fold over the five-year period from a mean rate of only 24 kgC d(-1) in 1990 to 2100 kgC d(-1) in 1993.

The increase of calcium and nitrate uptake rate between February 92 and March 92 suggested a higher ecosystem efficiency in nutrient retention with a higher temperature and light intensity and slower water velocity, discharge and water depth.

Biogeochemistry,1996,"Marti, E; Sabater, F",High variability in temporal and spatial nutrient retention in Mediterranean streams,"Nutrient retention studies were conducted in two second-order streams located north of Barcelona (Spain) that differed in watershed lithology, soil type, and vegetation. La Solana drains a calcareous watershed, whereas Riera Major drains a siliceous watershed. Within each stream we defined two reaches (50 m) differing in channel form and canopy cover: bedrock and sand-cobble. The bedrock reaches were characterized by a dominance of bedrock outcrop and a sparse canopy, while the sand-cobble reaches had sand, cobble, and boulder substrata and a dense canopy. Phosphate and ammonium uptake length and uptake rate were measured in each reach by performing several short-term additions (2 h) of phosphate and ammonium. Releases were conducted from summer 1990 to spring 1992 to encompass seasonal changes in environmental conditions. We examined temporal trends in nutrient uptake length to test the influence of watershed geomorphology and local channel form on nutrient retention in these two Mediterranean streams. Because both nutrients were added simultaneously, we were able, by using the ratio of each nutrient's uptake length, to compare ammonium and phosphate retention in each reach. Results of a two-way ANOVA indicated that both stream and reach type had significant effects on phosphate and ammonium uptake lengths. However, channel form had a different effect depending on the stream. In La Solana, shortest phosphate uptake lengths (highest efficiency in phosphate retention) were measured in summer, whereas shortest ammonium uptake lengths were measured in winter in the two reaches. In this stream, both nutrients were retained with greater efficiency in the bedrock reach than in the sand-cobble reach (mean uptake length was 59 +/- 12 m for phosphate and 59 +/- 14 m for ammonium in the bedrock reach, means +/- 1 SE, n = 13 for both nutrients; and 119 +/- 19 m for phosphate and 182 +/- 51 m for ammonium in the sand-cobble reach, n = 12 for each nutrient). In Riera Major, only the bedrock reach exhibited a seasonality in nutrient uptake length that was similar to that found in La Solana reaches. The sand-cobble reach in Riera Major showed higher efficiency in ammonium retention than the bedrock reach (85 +/- 16 m, n = 14; and 189 +/- 28 m, n = 10, respectively); but phosphate uptake lengths did not differ between reaches to a statistically significant extent (163 +/- 26 m in the sand-cobble reach, n = 14; and 191 +/- 32 m in the bedrock reach, n = 10). When the two streams were compared, La Solana exhibited higher nutrient retention efficiencies (shorter uptake lengths) than Riera Major. However, nutrient uptake rates for both nutrients were higher in Riera Major because of greater nutrient loadings. Mean phosphate uptake rates at ambient levels for the whole study period were 45.4 +/- 10.8 mu g P . m(-2). min(-1) in La Solana (n = 25) and 175.5 +/- 68.6 mu g P . m(-2). min(-1) in Riera Major (n = 24); and mean ammonium uptake rates at ambient levels were 103.3 +/- 27.4 and 186.7 +/- 48.6 mu g N . m(-1)min(-1), respectively. Finally, nutrient uptake lengths from this study are within the range reported for other streams of similar order. Overall results indicate that differences in ammonium retention efficiency in these streams may be tightly related to in-stream processes. In contrast, major between-stream differences in phosphate retention efficiency appear to be a function of overall phosphate availability.",ECOLOGY,77,3,,854,869,,10.2307/2265506,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:A1996UC98500020
Invertebrate,1996,"Miller, AM; Golladay, SW",Effects of spates and drying on macroinvertebrate assemblages of an intermittent and a perennial prairie stream,"We compared macroinvertebrate population and assemblage responses to seasonal spates and dewatering in an intermittent and a perennial prairie stream in southern Oklahoma. Total densities, population densities, and indices of assemblage structure were examined as response variables. A 90% reduction of total invertebrate densities at both sites suggested that assemblages had low resistance to spring and fall spates. Caenis, Leptophlebia, and Baetis mayflies were more resistant to spates than other common taxa. Recovery of total densities was slower after the fall spate relative to spring. This delay may reflect a reduced availability of colonists and low population growth rates due to lower temperatures. Invertebrate assemblage structure in both streams remained stable during the spring spate, either through resistance (intermittent stream) or resilience (perennial stream). Beyond a few weeks, the effects of the spring spate on assemblage structure was not evident in either stream. Long term assemblage stability was strongly influenced by the resistance and resilience of individual taxa, whose dominance was influenced by season and previous disturbance events. Periodic dewatering in the intermittent stream favored the establishment of spate-tolerant Caenis mayflies over other taxa, resulting in an assemblage highly resistant to spates. High resilience of perennial stream assemblages was associated with the rapid recovery of chironomids as the major taxon. Lower assemblage stability during the fall spate may be related to annual fluctuations in density and assemblage composition, and not necessarily to the spate itself. Summer drying affected intermittent riffle assemblage structure during flow periods by restricting the establishment of flow-dependent taxa, truncating the recovery of invertebrate densities after the spring spate, and favoring drought-tolerant taxa. Recolonization after drying was rapid and 21 taxa were collected 4 d after rewetting. Spates greatly reduced total densities; however, long term assemblage stability was maintained in both streams by individual taxa that were either highly resistant to disturbance (intermittent) or resilient (perennial).",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,15,4,,670,689,,10.2307/1467815,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1996WC65800022

We analyzed depositional patterns of trace elements in the otoliths of adult Lentipes concolor, an amphidromous goby endemic to Hawaii, to determine whether landlocked forms occurred. Otoliths were obtained from fish collected from the Hawaiian stream habitats most likely to harbor landlocked populations-upper elevations of interrupted streams and sections of streams above high waterfalls. A transition from a marine phase to freshwater existence was demonstrated as a decrease from high to low strontium : calcium ratios in the otolith with increasing distance from the otolith's core.

However, as a sequel to the public participation in desilting the tub, apart from the restoration of vegetation and monitoring of water flow in the catchment area, the silt intake was reduced to just 14 million tonnes per hectare per year during the early 1990s. The unique exemplary unison and coordination between the government and the public demonstrated in the form of ldquoShramdanrdquo (voluntary service) saved the wetland ecosystem from extinction. Strikingly however, in spite of the best conservation methods, the water input in the lake tub has been drastically reduced and the rate of silt inflow per unit water is relatively high. The excessive vegetation cover in the catchment due to stringent measures adopted is viewed as the reason for the situation.",Proceedings of Eco-Informa '96.

Invertebrate,1996,"Williams, DD",Environmental constraints in temporary fresh waters and their consequences for the insect fauna,"Temporary fresh waters are defined as bodies of fresh water that experience a recurrent dry phase of varying length that is sometimes predictable in both its time of onset and duration. The aquatic insects that live in these habitats are strongly influenced by 2 main groups of constraints, physicochemical and biological factors. Taxa particularly well-represented in temporary running waters are the Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and tipulid and chironomid Diptera. With the exception of Ephemeroptera, all these groups are common also in temporary lentic waters, but the latter also support many species of Odonata, together with culicid, ceratopogonid and ephydrid Diptera. In general, however, the diversity of aquatic insects is lower in temporary than in permanent waters. Seasonal succession of species is commonplace in temporary waters, affecting food web structure. Adaptations to drought are reviewed, and traits common to the most successful tara include a highly flexible life cycle, temperature-linked development, possession of a diapausing or otherwise protected egg, and high powers of dispersal. A trend towards terrestrialisation of immature stages is noted amongst at least some members of even strongly aquatic taxa. Several directions for future research are discussed including study of the controlling influence of the biological environment on the fauna and the former's interaction with physicochemical influences, temporal variation in the structure of food webs, and genetic analyses of populations. A recommendation is made for greater quantification in data collection particularly on seasonal changes in species abundance, their life histories, and trophic relationships, as this will allow greater opportunity for modelling the community dynamics of these ecologically distinct habitats. Finally, the concept that temporary waters constrain their faunas is exposed as being based more on human perception than on fact.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,15,4,,634,650,,10.2307/1467813,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1996WC65800020
Biogeochemistry,1997,"Abrams, MM; Jacobson, PJ; Jacobson, KM; Seely, MK",Survey of soil chemical properties across a landscape in the Namib Desert,"A selection of soils were sampled in the Central Namib Desert to investigate the importance of landscape and associated plant communities on soil nutrient status. Soils were sampled in an ephemeral river, a wash, and at two dune sites. The soils in the lower landscape positions, the Kuiseb River and an associated wash, had significantly higher nutrient levels than those at the dune sites. These lower landscape positions also had the most stable plant communities, Faidherbia albida and Welwitschia mirabilis, respectively. The two dune soils, which both support perennial herbaceous species, had extremely low nutrient levels. Only the wash showed nun-lent enrichment of the soil under plants, as measured by a relative enrichment factor. This community is the most established, with plants being hundreds of years old; this time factor may be crucial for nutrient accumulation by plants in this extremely arid system. The lack of enrichment under the F. albida community suggests that the fluvial inputs and exports, both organic and inorganic, tend to homogenize the nutrient levels within this system. These results indicate that soil nutrient levels in the Namib Desert are closely linked to landscape position and less so with the associated plant communities.

There was a high degree of similarity among references for parameters other than taxonomic composition (e.g. macroinvertebrate density, number of species, Shannon diversity, functional groups, etc.). Statistically significant differences were found between references and treatments and among harvest methods but the responses varied among response variables (density, Shannon-Weiner diversity, species composition), different species assemblages (all invertebrates, chironomids, Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera [EPT], isopods), and functional group categories (shredders, collector-gatherers).

The planning and operation of surface water supply must therefore take into account the natural variability and unpredictability of the rainfall and river flow. Environmental water requirements of unique wetlands at the mouths or deltas of internationally shared rivers have to be duly considered should any form of development be undertaken. Historically the westward flowing rivers were opportunistically utilized by nomadic people and their cattle. An. increase in population has resulted in increased pressure on the limited available resources. In the event of construction of dams on the ephemeral rivers, careful consideration has to be given to the possible effects on the downstream sites in these linear eases.

Neither hydrological nor climatological models for the region are sufficiently developed to describe the magnitude or direction of change in response to increased carbon dioxide; thus, an attempt to predict specific responses of aquatic ecosystems is premature. Instead, we focus on the sensitivity of rivers, streams, springs, wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes of the region to potential changes in climate, especially those inducing a change in hydrological patterns such as amount, timing and predictability of stream flow.The major sensitivities of aquatic ecosystems are their permanence and even existence in the face of potential reduced net basin supply of water, stability of geomorphological structure and riparian ecotones with alterations in disturbance regimes, and water quality changes resulting from a modified water balance. In all of these respects, aquatic ecosystems of the region are also sensitive to the extensive modifications imposed by human use of water resources, which underscores the difficulty of separating this type of anthropogenic change from climate change. We advocate a focus in future research on reconstruction and analysis of past climates and associated ecosystem characteristics, long-term studies to discriminate directional change vs. year to year variability (including evidence of aquatic ecosystem responses or sensitivity to extremes), and studies of ecosystems affected by human activity.

Biogeochemistry,1997,"Grimm, NB; Petrone, KC",Nitrogen fixation in a desert stream ecosystem,"Few measurements of nitrogen fixation exist for streams. Desert streams are warm, well lighted, and often support abundant cyanobacterial populations; thus N-2 fixation may be significant in these N-poor ecosystems. N-2 fixation was measured in situ by acetylene reduction for two patch types (Anabaena mat and an epilithic assemblage). Patch-specific rates were high compared with published values (maximum 775 mu g N-2 [83 mu mol C2H4] mg chl a(-1) h(-1) or 51 mg N-2 [5.4 mmol C2H4] m(-2) h(-1)). Daytime fixation was higher than nighttime fixation, and temperature, light and inorganic N concentration explained 52% of variance in hourly rates over all dates. Diel input-output budgets were constructed on five dates when cyanobacteria were present in the stream. Diel N-2 fixation rates were measured for comparison with reach-scale diel nitrogen retention, to assess the importance of this vector to N economy of the stream. Fixation accounted for up to 85% of net N flux to the benthos, but its importance varied seasonally. Finally, we applied biomass-specific fixation rates to 1992 and 1993 biomass data to obtain seasonal and annual N-2 fixation estimates. Cyanobacteria were absent or rare during winter and spring, thus most of the annual N-2 fixation occurred during summer and autumn. Annual rates of nitrogen fixation for 1992 and 1993 (8.0 g/m(2) and 12.5 g/m(2)) were very high compared to other streams, and moderately high compared to other ecosystems.

Biogeochemistry,1997,"Howard-Williams, C; Hawes, I; Schwarz, AM; Hall, JA","Sources and sinks of nutrients in a polar desert stream, the Onyx River, Antarctica","The Onyx River flows for over 30 km from its source in the Greenwood Valley, to discharge into endorheic Lake Vanda. It is the only significant source of meltwater, and hence allochthonous nutrients, to the lake. In recent years localised climatic change has resulted in an increase in the annual discharge in the river from 2.5x10(6) m(3) (1970s and early 1980s) to 5.5x10(6) m(3) (late 1980s and early 1990s). In order to better understand the potential consequences of increased river flow to nutrient loading to the lake, we undertook a series of studies in 1993/94 to identify the sources and sinks of nutrients within the Onyx River system. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients varied both with time and with distance down the river. During early flows the river water was rich in nutrients, with nitrate nitrogen reaching over 1500 mg m(-3) and dissolved reactive phosphorous 27 mg m(-3). This appeared to reflect two sources, freeze concentration of nutrients in the stream bed over winter, and selective enrichment with nitrate, probably via atmospheric deposition. Another source of nutrients during early flows was leaching from freeze damaged cells in microbial mats. However during these early flows much of this water did not reach Lake Vanda, but rather was lost to lateral groundwater recharge. During the main flow period, nutrients came predominantly from glacial melt, though nitrate enrichment persisted for several weeks. Water reaching Lake Vanda during the main flow period always had low concentrations of nutrients relative to source water. Two microbially active zones were identified which appeared to be responsible for nutrient stripping. These were Lake Brownworth at the head of the river and the ""Boulder Pavement"", some 4 km upstream of Lake Vanda. There was no relationship between discharge and nutrient concentrations and for most of the year a linear discharge:loading curve was found. Increased flows into Lake Vanda will therefore increase the nutrient loading, but have little effect on concentrations of nutrients in lake water, at least over the range of discharge seen in this study.",ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES IN ANTARCTIC ICE-FREE LANDSCAPES,,,,155,170,,,,International Workshop on Polar Desert Ecosystems,"JUL 01-04, 1996",,"CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",,90-5410-925-4,WOS:000072809000015

From June to September 1995, we did 8 short-term nitrate and chloride additions (4 additions before and 4 after a flood) in a 240-m reach to measure nitrate uptake length as an index of surface stream retention efficiency of nitrate. We also calculated nitrate uptake lengths based on a natural downstream decline in nitrate concentration, using data from the addition dates and from previous studies.Nitrate uptake lengths measured in Sycamore Creek were short (<120 m) compared to published values from other streams, indicating a high retention efficiency of nitrate in this nitrogen-limited stream. A midsummer flood caused a 2-fold decrease in retention efficiency of nitrate in the reach (i.e., nitrate uptake length increased from 61 to 124 m); however, this change was within the range of variation measured before the flood. Rapid algal recovery (23 d), the dramatic decrease in discharge, and a large transient storage zone may account for the apparent high resilience of nutrient retention efficiency to disturbance. Most of the temporal variation in nitrate uptake length during the study period was attributed to changes in the algal assemblage. In particular, retention efficiency of nitrate decreased when nitrogen fixers were abundant. Uptake lengths calculated from additions were always shorter than those from natural nitrate declines, supporting our hypothesis that nutrient uptake lengths from short-term nutrient additions reflect gross, rather than net, nutrient uptake. Uptake rates from short-term additions and from natural declines of nitrate over post-flood succession showed a similar temporal pattern, but the ratio between them increased late in succession. This result suggests that, during late successional stages, nutrient release processes became more important than nutrient uptake processes, a prediction that is consistent with the ecosystem succession and nutrient retention hypothesis.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,16,4,,805,819,,10.2307/1468173,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000071795200007

During the dry months, the corresponding values were 0.28 +/- 0.17, 0.27 +/- 0.16 and 0.93 +/- 0.57, respectively. River Kidogoweni discharged nutrients at rates equivalent to 5.37 +/- 4.69 kgN day(-1) in the form of NH4+, 9.83 +/- 8.59 kgN day(-1) as NO3- +NO2- and 9.00 +/- 7.87 kgP day(-1) in the form of PO43- during the wet months. Corresponding mean discharge rates during dry months were 0.013 +/- 0.009, 0.0057 +/- 0.0038 and 0.035 +/- 0.023, respectively.From the salinity distribution patterns, it is evident that during wet seasons, River Mkurumuji influences the nutrient distribution patterns of coral reef and seagrass zones, while River Kidogoweni influences the nutrient distribution pattern of the mangrove zone of the Bay. There seems to be minimal riverine influence during the dry seasons. The mean gross primary productivity of the Bay during the two seasons is a manifestation of this observation. Mean values for the mangrove, seagrass and coral reef biotopes, respectively, were: 540.41 +/- 222.63, 552.22 +/- 291.36, 388.88 +/- 247.12 mgC m(-3) day(-1) (wet seasons); and 377.67 +/- 159.7, 230.84 +/- 84.75, 240.27 +/- 115.29 mgC m(-3) day(-1) (dry seasons).The levels of dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations between the waters of both rivers are not significantly different (P=0.35), but are higher than for the Bay waters, which are characteristically oceanic. Gazi Bay nutrient levels are lower than those reported elsewhere within the region, therefore suggesting that the Bay is a relatively pristine environment.

Recolonization commenced rapidly after first flow. Most taxa were derived from the perennial upper reaches through drift, but contributions from an adjacent billabong and resting stages in the substratum were important in the early stages of species establishment at the most downstream site. The dry sandy sediments were also a significant refuge for microcrustaceans. On the basis of this work and a review of other research, it is concluded that the significance of dry-season refuges to recolonization of temporary streams when flow resumes is governed by the nature of the substratum, the severity of the dry season and the proximity of the stream to permanent waters.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,48,7,,633,645,,,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000071752800011

The investigations based on stamping two close cross-sections to know their spatial distributions in a heterogeneous bed substrate showed a heterogeneous pattern of colonization mainly influenced by hydrological variables as the current velocity, the size of the substrata (gravel-pebble-boulder). For the drifting algae, mainly composed with benthic species temporarily unhooked to the substrata, the heterogeneity of the distribution was reduced in fast flow which induced a mixing of the whole mass of water.For the periphyton, some results indicated that the greatest diversity and the highest chlorophyll concentration were found on pebble substratum where the current velocity was moderate. These results have also shown that the classical methods used to day for investigations were inadequate for most Mediterranean rivers.It was really difficult to estimate the water quality from classical index created for use in regular large plain rivers.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,59,1,,57,73,,,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:A1997WZ65000006

La Solana stream dried out completely during summer 1994. The recovery of the biofilm was studied in a laboratory experiment by immersing it in stream water. La Solana has a thick stromatolitic biofilm composed of the cyanobacteria Rivularia sp. and Schizothrix spp. Ectoenzymatic microbial activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase and phosphatase), (HCO3)-C-14 incorporation and respiration (Electron Transport System-ETS-activity) were measured immediately after rewetting and then every hour for 5 h. Both ETS and photosynthetic activities were low at the beginning of the rewetting but increased significantly after two hours. Recovery of enzymatic activities in the biofilm was immediate, since values measured at 0 h were similar to those obtained in the stream before drought. Enzymatic activities increased markedly after three hours to higher values than those reported before drought. All activities stabilized to initial values at the end of the experiment. We suggest that the rapid recovery of the biofilm metabolism could be supported by the stromatolitic structure of La Solana biofilm acting as a reserve of organic matter, as well as the rapid rehydration provided by the cyanobacteria sheaths. This implies that the biofilm can exploit short rainfall periods in dry summers.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,140,2,,261,271,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:A1997YB25300008

These streams exhibit many functional and structural characteristics that are the result of the pattern and amount of precipitation and whim differ from their mesic counterparts. Our objective was to determine the influence of leaf litter on ecosystem processes of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a typical Sonoran Desert stream, and to compare these results with knowledge gained from other regions.Patterns of nitrogen dynamics and respiration during leaf decomposition were similar for leaf packs in Sycamore Creek and previous studies of mesic streams. Macroinvertebrates in Sycamore Creek colonized natural and artificial leaf packs equally, and taxonomic composition did not differ significantly between leaf types, or between leaf pack communities and benthic communities. Shredder macroinvertebrates feeding on leaf material were absent. Leaf litter input to Sycamore Creek was low and litter residence time was reduced by flash floods. As a result, leaves played an insignificant role in terms of nutrient dynamics, energy flow, and macroinvertebrate assemblages in this ecosystem. Differences in the role of leaf litter between regions are attributed to channel and riparian form and to the frequency of severe disturbance, which are functions of meteorologic, hydrologic, and geomorphic features of the landscape.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,16,3,,612,626,,10.2307/1468148,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:A1997XW15000012
Assessment,1997,"Singhroy, V",Environmental management in developing countries: Remote sensing case studies,"One of the most serious threats to sustainable economic growth in developing nations is the increasing degradation of their natural ecosystems and the concurrent deterioration in the quality of life for their people. This paper presents two case studies on the utility of remote sensing as an environmental assessment and protection tool in two developing countries. These case studies were selected to represent the two major climatic regions where the majority of the world's poor live. Guyana is a small tropical country on the northern coast of South America where 80 percent of the country's revenues are used to service its debt. Jordan is a small arid to semi-arid country in the Middle East where the search for drinking water is directly linked to its development. In both these countries, as in many other developing countries, earth observation data are necessary for sustainable development.In Guyana, all of the productive agricultural lands and 90% of the population of Guyana live in the narrow and fertile coastal plain (500 x 20 km) which is below sea level. Recently, the coastal dikes constructed for sea defence and improving irrigation of agricultural areas have been eroded and broken in various areas, resulting in severe flooding. Large sections of the sea wall are collapsing and approximately 2/3 of the coastline needs permanent structures or replacement. It is estimated that future large scale flooding could destroy almost U.S. $1 billion of economic activity in the coastal areas. The failure of the coastal defences is the result of a combination of factors. These include the depletion of the mangrove forest buffer caused by wood cutting for fuel and choking by sling mud; the increase of wave activities possibly due to a gradual rise in the mean sea level; and the lack of maintenance of the engineering structures (dikes and earth dams).This case study discusses the use of combined synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and TM images for coastal zone mapping, for determining the priority areas of coastal repair and for the assessment of flood damage of the agricultural areas. The study has shown that parts of the Guyana coastline have changed by from a few meters to half of a kilometre over the past twenty years. This has serious implications for sea defence and commercial agriculture. Areas of erosion and accretion, mangrove forest depletion and agricultural land uses were identified.In Jordan, there is an urgent need to manage and utilise the water resources in order to comply with the immediate and projected water demand in the country. All the known aquifers have been explored. Water harvesting is a national priority as water supplies are being depleted by intensive pumping. The main concern is to optimise the utilisation of the ground water resources and to protect them against depletion and pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to map in detail the hydrogeology of the aquifers. This second case study reports on the use of C-HH SAR and SAR/TM integration for providing information on the surface hydrogeological characteristics and land use practices of these sensitive watershed areas. The SAR image was used to map wadis (their surface distribution, channel morphology, and surface roughness of the wadi sediments); hydrogeological characteristics of rock units - limestone, basalts and alluvium; fractures (used to target exploratory wells); and land practices necessary for environmental protection of the aquifers. Although the SAR image itself provided very useful information, a combination of SAR and TM provides a more suitable image to map the surface characteristics of the aquifers.These two case studies demonstrate the need to use appropriate remote sensing techniques to assist in environmental protection programmes in the developing world.",SPACE OF SERVICE TO HUMANITY: PRESERVING EARTH AND IMPROVING LIFE,1,,,165,177,,,,International Symposium on Space of Service to Humanity - Preserving Earth and Improving Life,"FEB 05-07, 1996","Int Space Univ; Comm Earth Observat Satellites; IEEE, Commun Soc; UN Off Outer Space Affairs","STRASBOURG, FRANCE",,0-7923-4344-1,WOS:A1997BJ39V00018

Assessment,1997,"Uys, MC; OKeeffe, JH",Simple words and fuzzy zones: Early directions for temporary river research in south Africa,"Although a large proportion of South Africa's rivers are nonperennial, ecological research into these systems has only recently been initiated. Consequently, we have little verified information about the ecological functioning of these rivers or knowledge of how best to manage them. High water demands in a semiarid region results in the flow of most perennial rivers being altered from permanent to temporary in sections, through impoundment, land-use changes, abstraction, etc. Conversely, sections of many temporary rivers are altered to perennial as a result of interbasin transfers or may be exploited for surface water. Effective and appropriate management of these modifications must be based on sound scientific information, which requires intensified, directed research. We anticipate that temporary river research in South Africa will, of necessity, be driven primarily by short-term collaborative efforts and secondarily by long-term ecological studies. At the outset, a simple conceptual framework is required to encourage an appreciation of current views of the spatial and temporal dynamics of nonperennial rivers and of the variability and unpredictability that characterize these systems. We adopt the view that perennial and episodic/ephemeral rivers represent either end of a continuum, separated by a suite of intermediate flow regimes. A conceptual diagram of this continuum is presented. in the absence of a functional classification for temporary rivers, a descriptive terminology has been systematically devised in an attempt to standardize definition of the different types of river regimes encountered in the country.

Structure is represented by a simple geometrical model; slow Row takes place in blocks with a network of low-permeability cracks. The blocks are separated by highly permeable karstic conduits that allow rapid flow, and these form the aquifer drainage system. The karat studied covers 110 km(2). It is fed by an interrupted stream draining a 35 km(2) non-karstic basin, contaminated at the entry to the karst by effluents from a sewage treatment station. The underground water reappears as a resurgence with an annual average flow of approximately 1 m(3) s(-1), after an apparent underground course of 8 km in the karst. Several local sources of pollution (effluent from septic tanks) contaminate the underground water during its course. Sixteen measurement operations were performed at 12 water points, between the interrupted stream and the spring. Some sampling points were at drains, and others were in the low-permeability fissured blocks. Comparison at each point of the concentrations of 14 chemical compounds gave the following results: when pollutant discharge occurs in a permeable zone, movement is rapid in the drainage network formed by the karstic conduits, and does not reach the less permeable fissured blocks which are thus protected; however, if discharge is in a low-permeability zone, the flow does not allow rapid movement of the polluted water, and this increases the pollutant concentration at the discharge, This simple pattern can be upset by a reversal of the apparent piezometric gradient between a block and a conduit during Floods or pumping; this may reverse flow directions and hence modify the movement of contaminants. The study made it possible to site five boreholes whose positions in the karstic structure were unknown, showing the interest of such an approach for the forecasting of the impact of potential pollution.

The present experiments with fish of the genus Poeciliopsis provide further evidence in support of this model. Sexual and clonal forms of Poeciliopsis live in the desert streams of Sonora, Mexico, and are exposed to environmental extremes ranging from flash floods to hot, desiccating, residual pools. We examined coexisting members of the monacha complex to see whether the fish types differed with respect to survival during stress and swimming endurance in an artificial flume. The two coexisting clones of the triploid gynogenetic fish P. 2 monacha-lucida differed dramatically: clone MML/II had the best survival during heat and cold stress and the worst survival during hypoxic stress, whereas clone MML/II had the best survival during hypoxic stress and the worst during heat stress. Poeciliopsis monacha, the sexual species with which these clones coexist, had intermediate survival during heat and hypoxic stress and very poor swimming endurance in the flume. The physiological differences seen in this study are consistent with the Frozen Niche-Variation model and provide some insights into environmental factors that affect the distribution and abundance of these fish.",EVOLUTION,51,5,,1593,1600,,10.2307/2411211,,,,,,0014-3820,,WOS:A1997YE98000026

This paper presents results of field studies in the following areas related to the sustainable development of the Safawi area in the northern Jordan Badia; geomorphology, including landform, soil, lands, processes and hazards, geology and physical resources and surface water hydrology. Tertiary-Quarternary continental basalt flows and tuffs cover approximately 11 000 km(2), the majority of the Safawi area. In addition to extensive basalt lava flows, the programme area includes a variety of geological outcrops and potential sources of economic products that include the following: tuff/Scoria, Zeolite/Olivine, Porcellanite, potential sources of aggregate/construction materials, ornamental stone, building stone, basalt for manufacturing of rock wool, and materials suitable for producing lightweight aggregate. The whole of the eastern Badia exhibits major fault systems, many of which were identified from landsat TM images. The system of wadis which drains the Badia is extensive, with the general flow from the north to the south and south-west. A noticeable geomorphic surficial deposit occuring throughout much of the Badia is fine-grained, water-lain sediments that vary in size and character. The local designation for the fine sediment deposits is Qaa. An MSS scene for the area under consideration has been studied. Twelve major geomorphic subdivisions or zones can be identified. Individual land system units have been identified by transversing the programme area. key sites have been visited based on Landsat TM image interpretation. To a large extent, key areas were subdivided after their initial identification on the landsat scene and corroboration in the field. The surface drainage of the Badia region can be broadly divided into wadi systems, areas of distinct channelized flow, and Qaa, predominantly fine-grained sedimentary basins of low relief. Spatial variability in infiltration rates across the wadi-Qaa system were determined from field experiments. Infiltration rates were found to be medium-high in the wadi channels but decrease rapidly for the Qaa materials. Apparently runoff from wadi side slopes will be high, and water storage occurs along the wadi channels while ponding occurs in the Qaa areas.",ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY,36,41671,,18,26,,,,,,,,0943-0105,,WOS:000077500000002

The females live for 8 years (7+) while the males only live for 7 years (6+). The males grow more slowly than the females; the maximum fork lengths observed were 153 mm in males and 220 mm in females. The equation of Von Bertalanffy that defines growth is: males: L-T = 208.227[1-e(-0.173(t+0.470))]; females: L-T = 448.897[1-e(-0.085(t+0.236))]. This growth rate is one of the lowest recorded for a European barbel population. The overall sex-ratio (265 males:185 females) differed significantly from equality. Sexual maturation occurs from the age class 0+ to 2+ in males, and from 1+ to 3+ in females. The females have multiple spawning, releasing 2 to 5 egg batches depending on their size, such that the largest females spawn more batches than the small ones. The regression between fecundity (Fa) and fork length (FL, mm) is: ln(Fa) = -7.97+/-3.26.ln(FL). The reproductive effort of the females increases progressively with age. The timing and length of the breeding season are related to periods of high stream flow. The life history pattern of this population is characterised by reduced longevity, precocious maturity, multiple spawning and high fecundity, these features being the result of adaptation to the characteristic instability of the river systems of the Mediterranean region.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,142,1,,95,110,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000073820700006

Primary ore minerals in both deposits include chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena. The Cyprus-Pinos Altos Mine ceased operation in 1995 and the Cleveland Mill closed in 1950. The deposits have similar mineralogical characteristics; however, the tailings are different in terms of age, degree of oxidation and method of disposal. The Cyprus-Pinos Altos tailings (CPAT) are stored in a lined, bermed impoundment. They are dominantly water-saturated and exhibit no secondary-phase formation. The grains are not cemented and show no evidence of primary-mineral dissolution. The geochemical data show a predominantly primary signature. The tailings pond water is neutral to slightly alkaline (pH from 7 to 8.3), partly as a result of processing methods.

They have undergone numerous wet/dry cycles resulting in extensive oxidation. Secondary minerals predominate, and consist mainly of jarosite, goethite, hematite, and Fe-oxyhydroxides and -oxyhydroxysulfates. The pH of the stream draining the CMT is as high as 2.15.

The concentration levels and the geochemical behaviour of nutrients, trace metals and organic pollutants were studied during the period 1991-1992, in a project supported by the Municipality of Trikala.

Biogeochemistry,1998,"Fisher, SG; Grimm, NB; Marti, E; Gomez, R","Hierarchy, spatial configuration, and nutrient cycling in a desert stream","Recent studies of nutrient cycling in Sycamore Creek in Arizona, USA, suggest that a thorough understanding requires a spatially explicit, hierarchical approach. Physical configuration determines the path that water follows as it moves downstream. Water follows flowpaths through surface stream components, the hyporheic zone beneath the surface stream, and the parafluvial (sand bar) zone. Characteristic biogeochemical processes in these subsystems alter nitrogen (N) species in transport, in part as a function of available concentrations of N species. At several hierarchical levels, substrate materials are an important determinant of nitrogen dynamics in desert streams. Sand is present in bars of variable size and shape, each of which can be considered a unit, interacting with the surface stream. Groups of these stream-sandbar units form a higher level, the reach. At the next higher scale, sandy reaches (runs) alternate with riffles. Where flowpaths converge, rates of N transformation are high and, as a result, change in concentration is a non-linear function of flowpath length. Disturbance by flash floods alters sandbar configuration. Between floods, the interaction of subsurface and surface flowpaths shapes configuration in each, thus a self-organizing element of spatial structure exists. Sandy runs are dominated by subsurface processes and are likely to be net nitrifiers while riffles are dominated by surface flow and are nitrogen fixers. Whether a stream ecosystem retains nitrogen, or transports it to downstream recipient systems, or is a net emitter of gaseous forms of N, depends upon the dynamics of a spatial mosaic of interacting elements. An understanding of the net effect of this mosaic requires a spatially explicit, hierarchical, multi-scale approach.",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,23,1,,41,52,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00704.x,,,,,,0307-692X,,WOS:000072219000004
Biogeochemistry,1998,"Fisher, SG; Grimm, NB; Marti, E; Holmes, RM; Jones, JB",Material spiraling in stream corridors: A telescoping ecosystem model,"Stream ecosystems consist of several subsystems that are spatially distributed concentrically, analogous to the elements of a simple telescope. Subsystems include the central surface stream, vertically and laterally arrayed saturated sediments (hyporheic and parafluvial zones), and the most distal element, the riparian zone. These zones are hydrologically connected; thus water and its dissolved and suspended load move through all of these subsystems as it flows downstream. In any given subsystem, chemical transformations result in a change in the quantity of materials in transport. Processing length is the length of subsystem required to ""process"" an amount of substrate equal to advective input. Long processing lengths reflect low rates of material cycling. Processing length provides the length dimension of each cylindrical element of the telescope and is specific to subsystem (for example, the surface stream), substrate (for instance, nitrate), and process (denitrification, for example). Disturbance causes processing length to increase. Processing length decreases during succession following disturbance. The whole stream-corridor ecosystem consists of several nested cylindrical elements that extend and retract, much as would a telescope, in response to disturbance regime. This telescoping ecosystem model (TEM) can improve understanding of material retention in running water systems; that is, their ""nutrient filtration"" capacity. We hypothesize that disturbance by flooding alters this capacity in proportion to both intensity of disturbance and to the relative effect of disturbance on each subsystem. We would expect more distal subsystems (for example, the riparian zone) to show the highest resistance to floods. fn contrast, we predict that postflood recovery of functions such as material processing (that is, resilience) will be highest in central elements and decrease laterally. Resistance and resilience of subsystems are thus both inversely correlated and spatially separated. We further hypothesize that cross-linkages between adjacent subsystems will enhance resilience of the system as a whole. Whole-ecosystem retention transformation, and transport are thus viewed as a function of subsystem extent, lateral and vertical linkage, and disturbance regime.",ECOSYSTEMS,1,1,,19,34,,10.1007/s100219900003,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000075676100003

Assessment,1998,"Graca, MAS; Coimbra, CN",The elaboration of indices to assess biological water quality. A case study,"Here we tested the application of a nodal analysis for the elaboration of biotic indices for particular stressing conditions. The work was carried out in an intermittent Mediterranean stream where superficial flow was absent during summer. The river was perturbed by an effluent with high pH, sulphates, nitrates and conductivity. ""Summer"" and ""winter"" samples were treated separately. We first identified groups of sites differing in taxonomical composition by cluster analysis. Then we tested whether groups of sites also differed in their abiotic characteristics. In the following step, groups of cooccurring taxa were also identified by cluster analysis. The indicator value of a taxa group was measured by fidelity measurements for site groups. Indicator taxa were incorporated in a water quality table. The biotic index in the water quality table clearly discriminated impacted from reference sites in the two following years and was correlated with the first axis of a correspondence analysis biplot which also discriminated impacted from clean sites. We suggest that nodal analysis can be a reliable technique for the identification of bioindicators and the elaboration of biotic indices. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Changes in both gases were monitored during four surveys of 24 h duration in 1993 in two second-order Mediterranean streams: Riera Major, a siliceous shaded stream and La Solana, a calcareous open stream. In the latter, diurnal changes in carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen showed similar, clear daily pattern when water discharge was low and algal activity high, indicating that although reaeration was high, changes In the two gases were greatly influenced by stream metabolism. In addition, diurnal changes in Ca2+ and DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) also showed a clear daily pattern, indicating that the precipitation of calcium carbonate was directly or indirectly affected by biotic processes. On the other hand, no relation between the two gases was observed in Riera Major, where turbulence was higher. In this stream, the concentration of dissolved oxygen was greatly affected by reaeration, but changes in carbon dioxide showed a clear daily pattern. The lack of agreement between the diurnal variation of the two gases observed in this stream may be explained by the difference in solubility, which led to marked differences in the exchange coefficient rate when turbulence is high.

Using hourly values of irradiance, community-specific photosynthesis irradiance relations (P-I) measured in the laboratory were used to estimate anal net and gross primary production over an annual cycle. The model (referred to as P-I model), showed good agreement (r(2) = 0.53 and r(2) = 0.62, p<0.001 for LS and RM, respectively) between estimated values and those measured in the field. The P-I model was also applied to estimate annual primary production after nutrient enrichment. Annual primary production was 50 gC m(-2) y(-1) for RM and 157 gC m(-2) y(-1) for LS before nutrient addition, but increased to 440 gC m(-2) y(-1) after nutrient addition. Light conversion efficiency (Ef) was higher for RM (0.25 %) than for LS (0.16 %) and it was significantly enhanced after nutrient additions (0.55 %). A comparison between the annual primary production values obtained in this study with those from other lotic systems in different climatic zones indicated that stream order, nutrient concentration and light availability are probably mon important than climate type in determining annual values of primary production in fluvial systems.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,141,4,,469,481,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000072984200007

To augment a drinking water supply, water is being diverted through the natural stream channel. Quantitative sampling of sediments and woody debris was conducted immediately before water diversion, immediately after and periodically during recovery, for three diversion events over a 2-yr period. Reduction in total density of macroinvertebrates was dependent on type of substrate, averaging 76% in sediments as compared with 66% on woody debris. Recovery was rapid for most taxa, which often reached predisturbance density in less than 1 mo. For the entire macroinvertebrate assemblage in 1992 and chironomids only in 1991, resilience was greater on woody debris than on sediments. Compared with sand, the common inorganic substrate in this stream, woody debris was more stable, due in part to its retention by debris dams. It appears that woody debris is an important refuge and source of recolonizers to this sandy prairie stream after flow disturbances.",AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST,139,2,,210,223,,10.1674/0003-0031(1998)139[0210:FDOMIS]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0003-0031,,WOS:000073657700003
Assessment,1998,"Hickey, K; Calzada, RL; DelVecchio, G",An intermittent stream investigation of a tidally influenced watershed in northern Puerto Rico.,"A study of the nature and extent of flow draining a small watershed along the north coast of Puerto Rico was performed. The small watershed, once part of the delta of a major river, was cut-off from the vast majority of the original watershed by a flood control project involving construction of diversion channels. An approach was applied whereby streamflow and water quality measurements were collected during the dry season of 1997 (i.e. February and March) in support of numerical modeling to predict streamflow during normal dry periods in the watershed.Field measurement of freshwater flows, a critical parameter for hydrologic modeling of basin yield under different conditions, was challenging in this tropical watershed and required innovative field reconnaissance and measurement techniques. Freshwater flows were small and mixed with tidal backwaters from a hydrologically connected estuary. Field measurement techniques included collection of total streamflow and water quality parameter (e.g., salinity) measurements at numerous locations throughout the tide cycle sufficient to allow small freshwater flows to be resolved from tidal backwaters. Numerical modeling focused on quantification of the temporal relationship between precipitation and streamflow in the system.","TROPICAL HYDROLOGY AND CARIBBEAN WATER RESOURCES, PROCEEDINGS",98,2,,71,78,,,,3rd International Symposium on Tropical Hydrology / 5th Caribbean Islands Water Resources Congress,"JUL 12-16, 1998","Amer Water Resources Assoc; Water Resource Res Inst; U.S. Geolog Survey, water Res Div; Water Resources Res Ctr","SAN JUAN, PR",,1-882132-43-2,WOS:000079025600012
Biogeochemistry,1998,"Holmes, RM; Fisher, SG; Grimm, NB; Harper, BJ",The impact of flash floods on microbial distribution and biogeochemistry in the parafluvial zone of a desert stream.,"1. The impact of flash flooding on microbial distribution and biogeochemistry was investigated in the parafluvial zone (the part of the active channel lateral to the surface stream) of Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream in central Arizona.2. It was hypothesized that subsurface bacteria were dependent on the import of algal-derived organic matter from the surface stream, and it was therefore predicted that microbial numbers and rates of microbially mediated processes would be highest at locations of surface to subsurface hydrologic exchange and at times when algal biomass was high.3. Prior to a flash flood on 19 July 1994, chlorophyll a was high (approximate to 400 mg m(-2)) in the surface stream and microbial numbers were highest at the stream-parafluvial interface and declined along parafluvial flowpaths, supporting the hypothesized algal-bacterial linkage. Immediately following the flash flood, chlorophyll a was low (approximate to 7mgm(-2)), and microbial numbers were reduced at the stream-parafluvial interface.4. Counter to expectations, parafluvial functioning (in terms of nitrate production and dissolved oxygen decline along flowpaths) re-established immediately after the flood receded. Therefore, material other than algal exudates supported parafluvial metabolism immediately postflood, and terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter is the likely source.5. Algae in the surface stream recovered quickly following flooding, but recovery of parafluvial bacteria lagged somewhat behind. These results highlight the importance of surface-subsurface interaction to stream ecosystem functioning and show that the nature of these interactions changes substantially in successional time.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,40,4,,641,654,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00362.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000077818600005

The abiotic environment of the streams was highly unstable with great variability in discharge during the wet season, but relatively constant during the short dry season. Overall, the number of individuals and species were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season. In all streams the composition of the fauna differed markedly between the two seasons, but no consistent change in community structure and proportions of functional feeding groups was found for the eight streams. In both seasons Baetidae, Simuliidae, Chironomidae and Elmidae were the four most numerous families. The equitability of the communities was, however, lower in all streams during the dry season. Collector-browsers were the most numerous organisms while filterers, predators and shredders were much less important. Maximum stream temperature was the single environmental parameter that best explained the variability in community structure among the streams. Otherwise the fauna was weakly correlated to site characteristics. The instability of these tropical Andes streams is probably the main feature structuring the invertebrate fauna. The streams may be alternating between a stochastic community structure during the wet season and early successional stages dominated by organisms with a fast growth and high colonisation capacity during the dry season.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,142,1,,53,70,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000073820700004

Eleven of 12 fish species present in the permanent streams colonized the experimental stream and preyed upon invertebrates, although fish composition differed significantly between the two streams. About 100 days after the initiation of the experiment, both species richness and diversity in the experimental stream reached almost the same level as that in the permanent streams. More diverse fishes colonized the complex section where habitat diversity was high compared to the simple section in the experimental stream.

The changes in the geochemistry of ground water caused by a major recharge pulse from the sinking stream were investigated using chemical and isotopic tracers and mass-balance modeling techniques, Nine monitoring wells were installed open to the uppermost part of the aquifer in areas near the sinks where numerous subterranean karst solution features were identified using ground penetrating radar. During high-flow conditions in the Little River, the chemistry of water in some of the monitoring wells changed, reflecting the mixing of river water with ground water. Rapid recharge of river water into some parts of the aquifer during high-flow conditions was indicated by enriched values of delta O-18 and delta deuterium (-1.67 to -3.17 per mil and -9.2 to -15.6 per mil, respectively), elevated concentrations of tannic acid, higher (more radiogenic) Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, and lower concentrations of Rn-222, silica, and alkalinity compared to low-how conditions. The proportion of river water that mixed with ground water ranged from 0.10 to 0.67 based on binary mixing models using the tracers O-18, deuterium, tannic acid, silica, Rn-222, and Sr-87/Sr-86. On the basis of mass-balance modeling during steady-state how conditions, the dominant processes controlling carbon cycling in ground water are the dissolution of calcite and dolomite in aquifer material, and aerobic degradation of organic matter.

"Fish, Assessment",1998,"Kingsford, RT; Boulton, AJ; Puckridge, JT","Challenges in managing dryland rivers crossing political boundaries: lessons from Cooper Creek and the Paroo River, central Australia","1. Dryland rivers are a focal point of life. Highly variable flows that underpin the ecology of these rivers are the antithesis of requirements for regular water for irrigation. Proposals exist to divert water for irrigation on the dryland rivers, Cooper Creek and the Paroo River in central Australia, that cross political boundaries of three Australian states (Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales).2. Poorly-planned water resource developments on dryland rivers incur unacceptably high ecological costs. Debate about the future of Cooper Creek and the Paroo River is challenging traditional political accountabilities for management hitherto focused on land rather than water. Diversion of water for irrigation threatens high conservation values of these unregulated rivers and livelihoods of rural communities who rely on floods. The current process whereby a Government water agency in one political jurisdiction assesses and judges the merits of proposals that have ecological consequences is restrictive. We critique current mechanisms for assessment, and approval of proposals to divert water from dryland rivers in Australia.3. An alternative is to begin with a discussion of the impacts of such proposals and ecological and social values under threat that involves a 'collaborative' resource management partnership between scientists, landholders and conservationists. Two scientific workshops on Cooper Creek and the Paroo River distilled such a process. This paper reviews the background to these workshops and their importance for decisions on sustainable management of dryland rivers and their floodplain wetlands. Scientific workshops involve the wider community in decision-making that is traditionally the province of water managers and developers. Transparency, independence and a catchment focus remain challenges for decision-making on the Paroo and the Cooper but the foundations were laid by the workshops.

Invertebrate,1998,"Langton, PH; Casas, J",Changes in chironomid assemblage composition in two Mediterranean mountain streams over a period of extreme hydrological conditions,"An opportunity to test Coffman's (1989) proposal that ecological heterogeneity is one of the main factors for chironomid species richness occurred when prolonged drought in southern Spain was broken by heavy rain. Chironomid assemblage composition was studied in two Mediterranean mountain first-order streams, one permanent and the other temporary. Samples were collected in the permanent stream over extreme hydrological conditions: 1991-95 with relatively low and stable flow, and 1996-97 with relatively high and unstable flow. The temporary stream flowed, and therefore was sampled, only during the second period. In the permanent stream, spate events resulted in a notable increase in species richness due to the arrival of 32 species and to the permanence of 81% of the species resident over the prespate period. This relatively high percentage suggests that chironomids, as a group, have important resilience properties. However, some species disappeared from the permanent stream after the spates and the considerable decrease in abundance of other species, shows that, at the species level, resilience may vary greatly within the Chironomidae. Most of the species that appeared in the temporary stream were the same as those of the permanent stream during the fast flow period despite the great ecological differences between the two streams under study, suggesting the key role of discharge in structuring chironomid assemblages. The outstanding exception was the fugitive species Orthocladius calvus, the most abundant species in the temporary stream during the initial successional stages but never collected in the permanent stream.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,390,41699,,37,49,,10.1023/A:1003589216389,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000080235900005

The fungi were most active in spring when the water was flowing and when breakdown was fast. Complete exclusion of one fungal species on one leaf species, presumably by competition, was observed twice. From June onwards, though fungal biomass remained high, fungal diversity and activity decreased, and further decay was presumably due to other microorganisms.

There were no significant differences in the overall amount of BPOM or its fractions between dates. In contrast, spatial variation was considerable between sites, in accordance with the high spatial heterogeneity of the stream. Habitat-specific variables (type and size of habitat, substrate, current, depth and type of primary producers) determined the production, retention and storage of the different BPOM fractions in the streambed.

Each stream class had a characteristic community structure, although the differences among classes were more in relative abundances than in presence or absence.

Biogeochemistry,1998,"Romani, AM; Sabater, S",A stromatolitic cyanobacterial crust in a Mediterranean stream optimizes organic matter use,"The bedrock of La Solana (NE Spain) stream is a thick calcareous cyanobacterial crust with a layered structure similar to a stromatolite. Different algal patches, which appear along with seasonal changes (especially discharge, temperature and light), characterize the stromatolite. This structure has a great capacity for organic matter utilization, as indicated by the high extracellular enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase and phosphatase) measured in the stromatolitic algal patches over an annual cycle. However, each patch showed a particular ability in the use of organic matter since a different hydrolytic potential capacity was measured. The highest P-glucosidase and beta-xylosidase activities were measured in the mixed community (cyanobacterial crust with a sparsely developed overstorey), indicating that the understorey of this stromatolitic crust is highly active. In the Zygnema-Spirogyra community, autotrophic activity might enhance P-glucosidase activity in spring, whilst in the diatom bloom (which appeared in May-June), polysaccharides released by algae and mucilagenous material from the diatom stalks might regulate the ectoenzymatic activities. The adaptation of the Rivularia community to oligotrophic conditions occurring in summer, autumn and winter is shown by the extremely high phosphatase activity, related to the low phosphorus concentration in stream water. The appearance and progressive substitution of the different patches can be interpreted as the adaptive response to the most available organic matter source, as well as a way of surviving the drastic environmental changes characteristic of Mediterranean streams.",AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,16,2,,131,141,,10.3354/ame016131,,,,,,0948-3055,,WOS:000077727000004
Assessment,1998,"Ronan, AD; Prudic, DE; Thodal, CE; Constantz, J",Field study and simulation of diurnal temperature effects on infiltration and variably saturated flow beneath an ephemeral stream,"Two experiments were performed to investigate flow beneath an ephemeral stream and to estimate streambed infiltration rates. Discharge and scream-area measurements were used to determine infiltration rates. Stream and subsurface temperatures were used to interpret subsurface flow through variably saturated sediments beneath the stream. Spatial variations in subsurface temperatures suggest that flow beneath the streambed is dependent on the orientation of the stream in the canyon and the layering of the sediments. Streamflow and infiltration rates vary diurnally: Streamflow is lowest in late afternoon when stream temperature is greatest and highest in early morning when stream temperature is least. The lower afternoon streamflow is attributed to increased infiltration rates; evapotranspiration is insufficient to account for the decreased streamflow, The increased infiltration rates are attributed to viscosity effects on hydraulic conductivity from increased stream temperatures. The first set of field data was used to calibrate a two-dimensional variably saturated flow model that includes heat transport. The model was calibrated to (1) temperature fluctuations in the subsurface and (2) infiltration rates determined from measured streamflow losses. The second set of field data was to evaluate the ability to predict infiltration rates on the basis of temperature measurements alone. Results indicate that the variably saturated subsurface flow depends on downcanyon layering of the sediments. They also support the field observations in indicating that diurnal changes in infiltration can be explained by temperature dependence of hydraulic conductivity. Over the range of temperatures and flows monitored, diurnal stream temperature changes can be used to estimate streambed infiltration rates. Tit is often impractical to maintain equipment for determining infiltration rates by traditional means; however, once a model is calibrated using both infiltration and temperature data, only relatively inexpensive temperature monitoring can later yield infiltration rates that are within the correct order of magnitude.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,34,9,,2137,2153,,10.1029/98WR01572,,,,,,0043-1397,,WOS:000075674800004

The principal cues tested for dispersal behavior were loss of water in the three beetle species, and rising water temperature in the Corixidae. Laccophilus maculosus and G. serrulata responded by flying, while S. roffii and T. elliptus responded by both flying and crawling out of the experimental aquaria. Graptocorixa serrulata was the most sensitive to high temperatures, while L. maculosus was the most tolerant, surviving well at 40 degrees C. Resistance to desiccation was low in all species, and most individuals dispersed before the third day of complete dryness. Those remaining did not survive. We suggest that the dispersal mechanism used by the various taxa depends on body morphology and the energy cost of dispersal.",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,43,1,,80,87,,,,,,,,0038-4909,,WOS:000073705300012

Numbers of live versus dead prey consumed were tested between and across three prey sizes. Five prey species were offered simultaneously (5 live and 5 dead specimens) in each size class. We found that A. herberti preferred live prey of small and medium size, but it chose mainly dead prey in the large size class. These results fitted the model of size-selective predation (Zaret, 1980). Size dependent predators selected prey of increased size, according to their visibility, but only up to where difficulty in handling and probability of escape affect successful consumption. Snails were the most preferred prey of A. herberti. By contrast, T. marmoratus consumed only dead prey of all sizes, bur it preferred soft organisms with thin cuticle, such as immature larvae of some mayflies, beetles, dragonflies or fishes.",AQUATIC INSECTS,20,2,,85,96,,10.1076/aqin.20.2.85.4500,,,,,,0165-0424,,WOS:000073281600002
Invertebrate,1998,"Williams, DD",The role of dormancy in the evolution and structure of temporary water invertebrate communities,"Temporary fresh waters support invertebrate communities that range from the complex, with many species (e.g., vernal ponds), to those that support only one or two species (e.g., ephemeral rock-pools and water-filled leaf axils). For the most part, these aquatic species are well adapted to dealing with the periodic disappearance of their medium, be it through drought or freezing. Dormancy is commonly the adaptation that makes persistence possible in such habitats. This paper illustrates the role of dormancy in controlling the structure and succession of invertebrate communities in temporary fresh waters. Habitat phase selection (succession) is seen as a crucial result of dormancy and this phenomenon is examined, in detail, by reference to case studies of intermittent streams and a vernal pond in Ontario. Although dormancy is believed to typically protect an organism from habitat adversity (e.g., drought or high temperature), it is argued that it may act also to synchronise organisms with some resource opportunity, such as period of algal bloom or an influx of riparian leaf litter, or to avoid predation and/or competition. Dormancy strategies occur more frequently in temporary and unpredictable (episodic) habitats. Within a single, widely distributed species there may be differences in dormancy expression according to habitat type. In temporary fresh waters, dormancy may result from simple loss of water from an animal's tissues (producing a quiescent state; e.g., as in the larvae of the rockpool chironomid Polyedilum vanderplanki), or from a more formal programme of arrested development involving complex external cues (true diapause; e.g., as in the eggs of many temporary pond mosquitoes). It is probably prudent to accept multiple evolutionary origins of dormancy, including those driven by the environmental features characteristic of temporary water habitats.","ADVANCES IN LIMNOLOGY, VOL 52: EVOLUTIONARY AND ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CRUSTACEAN DIAPAUSE",52,,,109,124,,,,Symposium on Diapause in the Crustacea,"AUG 24-29, 1997",Fund Sci Res Flanders; Serv Prime Minist; Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci; Natl Lottery; Univ Gent; Philips NV/SA; Van Hopplynus NV/SA; INVE Aquaculture NV/SA; Omnilabo NV/SA; Novolab NV/SA; VEL NV/SA; Merck Belgolabo NV/SA; Analys NV/SA; Air Liquide NV/SA; Laborimpex NV/SA,"GHENT, BELGIUM",0071-1128,3-510-47054-0,WOS:000089402600008

The growing population of this semi-arid area depends on groundwater from alluvial and sandstone aquifers. The public water supply serves only 30% of the population, with a mere 12% connected to mains sewerage. Quantification of the urban water balance showed that over 80% of the urban recharge is derived from cess pits, with smaller contributions from mains leakage, industry, irrigation and wadi flows. As a result, groundwater levels in the city are stable or rising, especially in shallow wells, in contrast to the regional trends. The alluvial aquifer shows signs of contamination, with high conductivity values in central Sana'a. Water quality in the sandstone aquifer remains good, with no recorded biological contamination, but the conductivity trends mirror those in the alluvium.

On successive sampling occasions, between 52.3 and 64.9% of fish were recaptured in the same 10-m-long section in which they had previously been captured. Movements over long distances were infrequent, and only 5.6% of the fish moved >100 m. The movement pattern of the population was seasonally stable, although the mean distances were slightly greater in summer because of the medium-range movements of a few individuals. Overall, upstream and downstream movements were equally common but a significant downstream movement occurred in spring. The size of the fish did not influence the movement rate. Fish inhabiting those sections of the stream with greater depth, slower current and more cover had a lower movement rate than fish occupying shallower, exposed sections. The restricted movement of B. haasi could increase the survival of fish by increasing the probability of staying in the remaining pools during summer dry-out, and may therefore be of adaptive significance.

Bioreactors were subjected to short-term pulses of allochthonous DOC, i.e. extracted from stream adjacent soils, and of autochthonous DOG, i.e. extracted from stream periphyton. In SOL biofilms, relatively high concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) co-occurred with retarded metabolic response to DOC pulses and relatively low respiration rates. In OSB biofilms, however, EPS concentrations were lower and respiration rates were elevated along with immediate metabolic responses to DOC pulses. Furthermore, the uptake rate of DOC from the bulk water increased linearly with the respiration rate in OSB biofilms, yet no such relationship existed in SOL biofilms. Carbon normalized respiration rates (mu g O(2) mg(-1) DOC h(-1)) generally revealed higher metabolic availability of autochthonous DOC than allochthonous DOC in both streams. Cross-feeding experiments (e.g. feeding OSB bioreactors with SOL DOC, and vice versa) revealed higher metabolic availability of terrigenous DOC from OSB than from SDL catchment soils. Cross feeding also suggested that autochthonous DOC from SOL inhibits the metabolism of OSB biofilms. We tentatively propose cyanobacterial toxins as the source of this inhibition. Contrasting pat terns of biofilm EPS concentrations, DOC immobilization and metabolism suggest an adaptive response of the microbial biofilm community to major catchment-scale (e.g. climate, vegetation and diagenesis of terrigenous DOC) and channel (e.g. storm frequency and scouring) processes in temperate and Mediterranean streams.",AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,19,3,,297,305,,10.3354/ame019297,,,,,,0948-3055,,WOS:000083765200009

We predicted that surface discharge patterns would influence retention and transport of fine sediments and particulate organic matter in a first-order intermittent stream, which in turn would affect microbial activity at different depths in the sediment. We measured sediments, dissolved and particulate organic carbon, and microbial and bacterial biomass and activity at three depths (surface and 20 and 40 cm) over a period spanning low and high flows at five stations on an intermittent stream. Discharge influenced physicochemical and sediment characteristics at the upstream stations with coarse substratum. In the finer sediments of the lower reaches, an active hyporheic microbial assemblage primarily governed sediment and organic dynamics. With decreasing discharge and increasing retention of fine sediments and particulate organic carbon, greater microbial hydrolytic activity in bed-sediments occurred downstream. Dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, fine sediments, microbial biomass, hydrolytic activity, and bacterial biomass declined with depth, and changed over time, apparently in response to varying discharge. We conclude that discharge and substratum particle size may interact to control organic dynamics and hyporheic microbial activity in a Ist order stream.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,56,3,,487,495,,10.1139/cjfas-56-3-487,,,,,,0706-652X,,WOS:000081027800014

Duration of surface flows varied substantially over the period of study, ranging from 266 days in 1993-1994 to 215 days in 1994-1995 and 137 days in 1995-1996. The stream bed dried completely during summer and/or fall in all three years. Fifty-five species emerged from the stream during the study, with Orthocladiinae having the greatest species richness (26 taxa), followed by Chironomini (14), Tanytarsini (10) and Tanypodinae (5). No Diamesinae, Prodiamesinae, Podonominae nor Pseudochironomini were present. Annual emergence varied considerably with 29 species in 1993-1994, 49 species in 1994-1995 and only 6 species in 1995-1996. During the first two years the phenological patterns resembled those expected for small, cooler-water streams, with winter and early spring emergence dominated by Orthocladiinae. The peak in emergence of Orthocladiinae was followed by a small but distinct increase in Tanytarsini in early spring, then Chironomini became more common as water temperatures increased and surface discharge declined. The timing of emergence was strongly influenced by the date at which surface discharge began, and resulted in about a 2 month shift between 1993-1994 and 1994-1995. Averaged over the three years of the study, emergence was dominated by seven species: Corynoneura sp. 1, Corynoneura sp. 2, Orthocladius lapponicus, Parametriocnemus cf. lundbecki, Thienemanniella sp., Larsia decolorata, and Zavrelimyia sinuosa.

Whereas temporal trends have often been studied, less information exists on spatial patterns of nutrient availability, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. The goals of this study were (1) to describe and quantify patterns of nutrient concentration in surface waters of an arid land stream and (2) to compare spatial patterns of nutrient availability across nutrients and over a successional sequence.We describe changes in the spatial pattern of stream water nutrient concentrations over successional time (between floods) using quantitative measures of heterogeneity. Samples were collected from the middle of the channel every 25 m over a 10-km section of a Sonoran Desert stream during three periods: early succession (2 wk post-flood), middle succession (2 mo post-flood), and late succession (9 mo post-flood). Nutrient concentrations were extremely variable in space (coefficients of variations as high as 145%). Coefficients of variation increased over successional time and were consistently greater for nitrate-nitrogen than for soluble reactive phosphorus. Semi-variogram analysis showed that nutrient concentrations were spatially dependent on all dates, but to different degrees and over different distances. The distance over which nutrient concentrations were spatially dependent, as measured by the semi-variogram range, tended to decrease with successional time. The strength of spatial dependence, as measured by the slope of the ascending limb of the semivariogram, increased with successional time. The limiting nutrient, nitrogen, was consistently more spatially heterogeneous than phosphorus or conductivity, both in terms of patch size (range) and strength of spatial dependence.In streams, downstream transport combined with nutrient transformation produces patches of similar nutrient concentrations that are elongated compared with nutrient patches in terrestrial soils. Variation in nutrient concentration is likely to affect the spatial distribution of organisms and rates of ecosystem processes.",ECOLOGY,80,7,,2283,2298,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000083009400013
Biogeochemistry,1999,"Dent, CL; Henry, JC",Modelling nutrient-periphyton dynamics in streams with surface-subsurface exchange,"Stream ecosystems include both surface and subsurface components that are connected by the flow of water. Processes occurring in subsurface sediments affect those in the surface, and vice versa. A model was developed to investigate the effects of nutrient transformations occurring in subsurface sediments on the growth of surface-dwelling periphyton. In the model the stream is divided into three zones: free-flowing surface water, a surface storage zone where flow is minimal and where periphyton growth occurs, and a subsurface zone. Parameters were based on information from Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited desert stream that has been extensively studied. The behavior of the model was examined both at steady state and as it approached steady state after periphyton biomass was reduced to low values, simulating the effects of a scouring flood. Previous work has shown that subsurface sediments are a source of inorganic nutrients, mainly nitrogen, to surface water and to periphyton communities in Sycamore Creek. Thus it was expected that in this model, periphyton biomass would increase when exchange between surface and subsurface zones was increased, and biomass would also increase when the rate of nutrient transformation in subsurface sediments was increased. Model results confirmed the expectations and highlighted the important role of organic nitrogen in mediating the periphyton-nutrient feedback. Post-flood recovery of periphyton biomass was particularly sensitive to elevated concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in flood water. The model shows that processes in the subsurface zone can have a large effect on surface organisms, and illustrates how surface periphyton communities interact with subsurface microorganisms through the recycling of nutrients.

Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from Aboriginal cooking pits, exposed by this erosion, indicates that the current phase of incision of the valley floor has occurred since grazing of domestic animals began about 140 years ago. Stratigraphic evidence is presented which suggests that this type of incision (gullying or arroyo cutting in the valley floor) may not have occurred before within the 20,000 year sedimentary history of the valley fills studied.

We tested the combined effects of secondary consumers (fish) and limiting nutrients (nitrogen) on intermediate trophic levels in an open stream environment, where flow redistributes organisms and materials among patches of streambed habitat. Fish reduced the biomass of the dominant herbivore (baetid mayflies) within habitat patches both by direct predation and by causing increased emigration from the patches. The resulting decrease in herbivory caused an increase in the growth and biomass of primary producers (algae) in areas containing fish. Independent of the effect of fish, algal growth and biomass was increased by augmenting the nutrient supply to patches. Nutrient-enriched areas (with high algal biomass) also supported greater populations of herbivores because they either grew faster in these areas or emigrated less frequently from them. Controlling influences on trophic structure came from both the top and the bottom of the food chain, and these influences were not conditional upon one another. Trophic structure in this system was determined by a mix of behavioral and trophic interactions between the major taxa, most of which were specific to open systems and not predicted by conventional theory.",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,44,5,,1187,1197,,,,,,,,0024-3590,,WOS:000081639000001
Assessment,1999,"Gaillot, S; Piegay, H",Impact of gravel-mining on stream channel and coastal sediment supply: Example of the Calvi Bay in Corsica (France),"Beach erosion during the last three decades in Calvi Bay, Corsica, is described and linked to a reduction of gravel and sand delivery from the Figarella and Flume Seccu coastal streams. Recent assessment of bedload transport during a 1 in 2 year flood and stream bed changes; evaluated from aerial photographs and field measurements (cross-sections, long profiles, sediment size analysis) show these streams deliver less and less sediment to the beach, thereby explaining its erosion.Two main causes explain this trend: (1) in-channel gravel-mining has been operated on these streams since the 1970's and (2) significant land-use changes have taken place in their watershed since the end of the 19(th) century. The gravel pits trap sediments and induce adjustments in channel geometry. An alder forest that colonized the gravel pit on the Flume Seccu traps most of the sand delivered by the watershed and represents a major flood risk because vegetation encroachment has increased hydraulic roughness. The excavation in the Figarella measures 600 000 m(3), corresponding to a channel degradation of 3 m. Channel degradation and armoring are also observed upstream and downstream of the excavation due to progressive and regressive erosion as a result of bedload transport disruption and downstream winnowing. The winnowing process has been very effective because bed material is heterogeneous. Field measurements demonstrate that less than 50% of the beach sediment deficit results directly from mining. Beach erosion is also linked to decreases in sediment delivery from the watersheds. Channel patterns have simplified even in the reaches which are not affected by mining. Braided channels have been replaced by single-bed channels and most of the channels observed in aerial photographs from the 1950's are now vegetated. Late 19(th) c. agricultural decline has led to land-use changes, croplands and pasture being replaced by spontaneous undergrowth and woods, reducing erosion and run-off.Beach erosion, due initially to watershed land-use and channel changes on coastal streams occuring since the Late 19(th) century, and worstened by gravel-mining, is far hom under control. As gravel pits will continue to trap sediments for several decades, decision-makers should favor natural or artificial solutions to increasing sediment delivery if they want to maintain the beach, essential to the local tourist industry.",JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,15,3,,774,788,,,,,,,,0749-0208,,WOS:000081365000016

Correspondingly, aquatic communities undergo a yearly cycle whereby abiotic (environmental) controls that dominate during floods are reduced when the discharge declines, which is also a time when biotic controls (e.g. predation, competition) can become important. As the dry season progresses, habitat conditions become harsher; environmental pressures may again become the more important regulators of stream populations and community structure. In contrast to the synchronous input of autumn litterfall in forested temperate streams, riparian input to mediterranean-type streams is more protracted, with fall and possibly spring peaks occurring in streams in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer peak existing in their Southern Hemisphere counterparts. We present 25 testable hypotheses that relate to the influence of the stream hydrograph on faunal richness, abundance, and diversity; species coexistence; seasonal changes in the relative importance of abiotic and biotic controls on the biotic structure; riparian inputs and the relative importance of heterotrophy compared to autotrophy; and the impact of human activities on these seasonally water-stressed streams.

A total of 2105 pieces of wood were painted at 8 sites dong the river channel to measure retention patterns. The flood had a peak discharge of 159 m(3)/s at the upper end of the study area, decaying to <1 m(3)/s by 200 km downstream. Downstream export of wood from marking sites totaled 59.5% (n = 1253). Transport distances ranged from 1 to 124 km, and 34.8% (n = 436) of the exported wood was recovered. Marked wood retained within marking sites was significantly longer than exported wood (p < 0.001, t-test). Once in transport, there was little correlation between wood length and distance traveled (r = 0.11, correlation analysis, n = 369). Length influenced the site of retention; material retained on debris piles was significantly longer than that stranded on channel sediments (p < 0.001, t-test). In-channel growth of Faidherbia trees significantly influenced wood retention; 83.7% of marked wood not moved by the flood was associated with debris piles on Faidherbia trees. Similarly, 65% of the exported wood retained within downstream debris piles was associated with Faidherbia trees. In contrast to many perennial systems, we observed a general increase in wood retention downstream, peaking in the river's lower reaches in response to hydrologic decay. Debris piles induced sediment deposition and the formation of in-channel islands. Following flood recession, debris piles and their associated sediments provided moist, organic-rich microhabitats, which were focal points for decomposition and secondary production, mimicking patterns reported from the channels of perennial streams and rivers.

Assessment,1999,"Juanico, M; Friedler, E",Wastewater reuse for river recovery in semi-arid Israel,"Most of the water has been captured in the rivers of Israel and they have turned into dry river-beds which deliver only sporadic winter floods. In a semi-arid country where literally every drop of water is used, reclaimed wastewater is the most feasible water source for river recovery. Two topics are addressed in this paper: water quality management in rivers where most of the flowing water is treated wastewater, and the allocations of reclaimed wastewater required for the recovery of rivers and streams. Water quality management must consider that the main source of water to the river has a pollution loading which reduces its capability to absorb other pollution impacts. The allocation of treated wastewater for the revival of rivers may not affect negatively the water balance of the region; it may eventually improve it. An upstream brute allocation of 122 MCM/year of wastewater for the recovery of 14 rivers in Israel may favor downstream reuse of this wastewater, resulting in a small neto allocation and in an increase of the water resources available to the country.

Invertebrate,1999,"Lytle, DA",Use of rainfall cues by Abedus herberti (Hemiptera : Belostomatidae): A mechanism for avoiding flash floods,"Unlike most aquatic invertebrate taxa in desert streams, adults and juveniles of the giant water bug Abedus herberti Hidalgo experience low mortality from flash floods (<15%, as opposed to >90%). One explanation is that A. herberti use periods of torrential rainfall (>15 cm . hr(-1)) that often precede flash floods as a cue to abandon streams. ""Stream abandonment behavior"" consisted of exiting the stream after some threshold duration of torrential rainfall (8.0 min for adults, 29 min for juveniles), moving in a negatively geotactic direction away from the stream, and stopping in a sheltered area away from the active scream channel. Individuals crawled as far as 23 m from the stream, but returned within 24 h. Experiments with simulated rainfall demonstrated that the behavioral cue for stream abandonment behavior is probably related to the impact of rain on the stream surface, and not to other chemical or physical cues associated with inputs of rainwater (i.e., changes in pH ion concentrations, water temperature, turbidity, or discharge) or approaching thunderstorms (i.e., pressure drops, thunder lightning, or cloud cover). These other cues may play an auxiliary role in the behavior, however Stream abandonment behavior can only account for part of the high survival rates observed for A. herberti during flash floods, since less than a third of observed individuals responded to either natural or simulated rainfall.",JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR,12,1,,1,12,,10.1023/A:1020940012775,,,,,,0892-7553,,WOS:000080902700001

Bacteria were counted using epifluorescence microscopy after sonication, and DAPI and acridine orange staining. ETS activity was measured with a spectrophotometer by the reduction of INT to INT-formazan. The results point out the overwhelming influence of water on bacterial distribution: bacteria were most abundant and larger during the flowing phase of the river and in a permanent pool. ETS activity on leaves was higher in water than in air, and during submersion it was higher in the permanent than in the temporary sites. Some temporal correlations were found with temperature and dissolved organic matter. Bacterial density peaked in May, and ETS activity in June.

Spring-fed tributaries originating within the Grand Canyon had higher macroinvertebrate biomass than tributaries draining large watersheds from outside the Grand Canyon. Tributaries that receive a substantial amount of their water from terrestrial runoff typically are less stable, have higher turbidity, and fewer food resources so that fewer species and/or individuals can be sustained.

The density and biomass of fish were greater in downstream rivers and sites. Along the Xevora River, a series of point abundance samples showed evidence of fish zonation along the river. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested a simple relationship between the different species and their preferred habitat. The small-sized Rutilus alburnoides and Leucisus pyrenaicus used most or all of the habitats with some cover and flowing water. Greater concentrations of larger fish were found in downstream reaches which generally had greater depths as stream width increased: large Barbus microcephalus, B. steindachneri and B. comiza preferred such sites on the Degebe River. Droughts in seasonal Mediterranean streams such as the Guadiana River are a predictable natural disturbance. In the summer, flow ceases and some stretches of river consist of isolated pools. This results in intense aggregations of fish and possible competition for food and/or space. Although some species are well adapted to natural droughts, habitat degradation and possibly the introduction of exotic species contribute to marked variability in species composition.

Such models are extremely important for the generation of flows of streams with short record length. The study presents a model for the generation of daily flows of an intermittent stream. The model is based on Markov chains and has four steps: (i) determination of the days on which flow occurs, (ii)determination of the days on which a flow increment occurs, (iii) determination of the flow increment, and (iv) calculation of the flow decrement on days when the flow is reduced. In the first two steps, two 2-state Markov chains are used for determination of the state of the stream. In the third step of the model, it is assumed that increments occurring on the ascension curve of the hydrograph are gamma distributed. In the fourth step of the model, the recession curve of the hydrograph is calculated by an exponential decay function with two different coefficients. Parameters required for the model are estimated from daily flows for each month of the year. The model is applied to a daily series of 35 years length.

Fish,2000,"Alkins-Koo, M",Reproductive timing of fishes in a tropical intermittent stream,"Six fish species were studied in an intermittent lowland stream in Trinidad, West Indies for 28 months from 1980 to 1982. They were Gasteropelecus sternicla, Corynopoma riisei, Astyanax bimaculatus, Hemigrammus unilineatus, Corydoras aeneus and Poecilia reticulata. Peaks in GSIs and presence of mature adults and juveniles, as determined from monthly field collections, indicated reproduction coincident with the rainy seasons in all species except Poecilia. Gasteropelecus bred for a short period at the beginning of the main rainy season while Corynopoma, Corydoras and Hemigrammus had extended periods of breeding activity each year coincident with high rainfall. The presence of juveniles suggests that Astyanax also bred during the rainy season. Poecilia reproduced continuously throughout the study period but exhibited discharge-related adult stock fluctuations that may have influenced reproductive activity. Maximum ovarian fecundity correlated with species size suggested body size limitation on fecundity for small species such as Corynopoma and Hemigrammus. Size frequency distributions of oocytes in mature ovaries indicate synchronised ovum maturation in Astyanax and possibly Gasteropelecus, while Hemigrammus, Corynopoma and Corydoras showed evidence of continuous maturation of oocytes and multiple spawning. Prolonged small brood spawning was confirmed in the laboratory for Corynopoma and Hemigrammus and resulted in spawning fecundities up to 11 times greater than ovarian fecundities for Corynopoma. It is concluded that the conditions of intermittency in this stream did not significantly alter the reproductive styles of these species as described for other Neotropical environments, perhaps because of their opportunistic nature.

Assessment,2000,"Boulton, AJ",River ecosystem health down under: Assessing ecological condition in riverine groundwater zones in Australia,"Below many rivers and extending laterally beneath their banks lies a zone of saturated sediments-the hyporheic zone. This region is the site of dynamic exchanges of water and materials between the groundwater below, lateral alluvial aquifers, and the river flowing above. In this centrally located ecosystem component, the actions of the microbial biofilms coating the sediments are considered to act like a biological filter, enhancing water quality during the exchange process. However, the hyporheic zones in many rivers are threatened by siltation, toxicants and increasing acidity, physical extraction for gravel, or altered groundwater inputs through pumping. Current protocols to assess river health do not explicitly consider that of the hyporheic zone, despite its central role in many rivers. This oversight is due largely to the relative infancy of the discipline of hyporheic research, limited communication to river managers by ecologists, and technical difficulties in sampling the hyporheic zone. Ecosystem health assessments in rivers with potentially important hyporheic zones could include measurements of the extent of hydrological exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone at a range of scales, the rates of some key interstitial chemical processes, and perhaps the biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates. In Australia, the potential of some of these measurements is being investigated, especially in relation to assessing the health of ""groundwater-dependent ecosystems.""",ECOSYSTEM HEALTH,6,2,,108,118,,10.1046/j.1526-0992.2000.00011.x,,,,,,1076-2825,,WOS:000087945900005

Rainfall and stage were recorded using automatic logging equipment and discharge was estimated using measurements of channel cross-sections and water depth estimated from trash lines. Total precipitation in the Rambla de Torrealvilla was 50 mm in 2 days with maximum rainfall intensities of 80 mm h(-1) Total rainfall in the Rambla de Nogalte was 195 mm in 3 days, with maximum intensities of 200 mm h(-1). In the Torrealvilla, this rainfall produced three flood peaks with maximum stage approaching 2.5 m. In the Nogalte, there was only one flood peak, which was 0.5 m deep. Estimated discharge varied widely throughout both catchments with maxima of 120 m(3) s(-1) in the Torrealvilla and 60 m(3) s(-1) in the Nogalte. Maximum discharges occurred at times of high rainfall intensity, but intensity alone did not explain why some tributaries had very small discharges. Variations in discharge in the ephemeral channels were due to combinations of lithology, morphology and land use. The predominantly marl catchment of the Torrealvilla had a lower threshold rainfall intensity than the schists of the Nogalte. Within each catchment sub-basins characterised by steep, gorge like terrain and sub-basins where agriculture had been abandoned both resulted in higher flood discharge. The contributing areas for the September storms were up to two thirds of tributary catchment areas, Comparison of rainfall data records shows that the September flood was the fifth largest on record and had a recurrence interval of 7 years. The largest (1973) flood, which is known to have caused substantial damage and a number of deaths, was only a 30-year event. The floods on the Torrealvilla destroyed at least two check dams and evidence suggests that these had little effect on reducing the impact of the floods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Assessment,2000,"Chintala, RS; Allen, PM","Channel response and sediment yields in Brookeen Creek, Central Texas","Land and water management activities such as agriculture, soil conservation, and reservoirs for water supply and flood control, have caused channel degradation in many first and second order ephemeral streams that drain nearly 70 percent of the cohesive environments of the Blackland Prairie. Resurveyed historic cross-sections on Brookeen Creek, a 16 square mile agricultural watershed in Hill County, Central Texas, revealed a maximum channel incision of 7 feet during a 33 year period (1958-1991). Degradation induced channel bank failures are evident in the form of slumps and block failures. Channel incision has exposed the Taylor Marl bedrock along the entire creek. Comparisons of measured storm sediment with sediment yields calculated using the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) indicate that nearly 50 percent of the total watershed sediment yield may be contributed by channel loss. The average measured storm sediment yield was 4.4 tons/acre.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers models HEC-1 and HEC-2 were used to quantify the hydrologic and hydraulic parameters to describe channel development. Bankfull discharges nearly doubled with the onset of agriculture in this region. Land area under soil conservation increased by 14 percent from 1943 to 1991, but did not alter peak discharges significantly. Modeled channel velocities for bankfull flows are erosive and in the range of 6 to 11 feet per second. According to the widely accepted conceptual model of channel process-response by Harvey and Watson (1986), Brookeen Creek has progressed from a Type I degrading stream in 1958 to a Type II degrading stream in 1991 and has entered stage III-IV. The study reach is currently aggrading, banks are still failing, and at least 1.5 feet of aggradation is required to establish an equilibrium slope and stable bed and bank conditions.

Aquatic insects composed 95% and 94% of the surface fauna in the intermittent and perennial streams, respectively, and were dominated by chironomids and caddisflies (eg, Apatania, Neothremma, Parthina). Noninsects composed 73% and 59% of the hyporheic fauna in the intermittent and perennial streams, respectively, and were dominated by archiannelids and harpacticoid and cyclopoid copepods. Faunal overlap between the intermittent and perennial streams was high (Jaccard coefficient 0.88 for surface fauna and 0.82 for hyporheic fauna). The intermittent stream surface fauna had lower total densities, taxon richness, and species diversity compared to that of the perennial stream; the hyporheic fauna in the intermittent stream had lower densities, similar richness, but higher species diversity.We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to test the hypothesis that the hyporheic zone serves as a refuge for surface invertebrates when surface flow ceases. If the hyporheic zone serves as a refuge, then hyporheic densities during the dry period should increase in the intermittent stream relative to the perennial stream. However, during the drying process, populations of temporary hyporheic resident invertebrates remained unchanged (Sweltsa) or decreased (Baetis, Parthina, Ceratopogonidae), but densities of the permanent hyporheic resident (Archiannelida) increased. This result suggests that the hyporheic zone was not a refuge from drying for surface invertebrates inhabiting this intermittent stream.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,19,4,,680,696,,10.2307/1468126,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000166307900009

Overall, we recorded 202 aquatic and semi-aquatic species, including at least 13 previously undescribed taxa. Species richness in temporary forest streams (greater than or equal to 125 species) exceeded that in a permanent headwater (100 species). Richness in ephemeral streams was 35 species or less. Duration of flow, exposure (shaded or open), riffle-pool structure and summer-drought conditions were key factors shaping community composition between and within stream types. We conclude that the potential of summer-dry streams with respect to habitat function is still widely underestimated.

Water quality during base-flow conditions was compared with that of runoff samples from infrequent winter and summer storms. The largest fraction of annual discharge in these ephemeral streams consists of storm runoff, although springs provide a steady source of low discharge base now to numerous intermittent perennial reaches.Several abandoned mines in the northern Patagonia Mountains contribute acid and heavy metals to streams. During base-flow conditions in mineralized areas, natural springs and intermittent stream reaches produce acidity but the volume is typically low and acidity is often diluted or neutralized down gradient. Overland runoff contains low concentrations of dissolved metals and moderate acidity, however, stream waters were strongly acidified and metal-laden from contact with abundant pyrite-bearing stream sediments derived from erosion of waste-rock material in and along the sides of the stream channel.","ICARD 2000, VOLS I AND II, PROCEEDINGS",,,,411,+,,,,5th International Conference on Acid Rock Drainage (ICARD 2000),2000,,"DENVER, CO",,0-87335-182-7,WOS:000169875500043

Three different neural architectures (5-6-6-1, 5-8-8-1 and 5-10-10-1), whose 'training' was carried out controlling three threshold determinism coefficients (R-t(2): 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9), were trained to estimate the GSI of an introduced pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) population inhabiting a highly fluctuating Mediterranean stream in southern Spain. This GSI estimate was made using several easily measured fish and environmental variables. The correlation (R) between the GSI observed (GSI(r)) and the GSI predicted by the CNN (GSI(e)) was very high (> 0.8 in all cases). The optimal CNN structure was the 5-6-6-1 with R-t(2) = 0.8 because it produced the best generalization of the confidence limits of GSI(e) with respect to GSI(r). To compare with traditional multiple regression analysis, we submitted the data to the same process as with CNN. The validation of the regression model produced a much lower correlation (R) than the CNN models. As an example of the predictive capacities of the CNN models, we predict the hypothetical pumpkinseed reproductive cycle of our population but under the environmental conditions found in the Camargue marshes (South France).",AQUATIC SCIENCES,62,4,,350,363,,10.1007/PL00001340,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000166273800005
Assessment,2000,"Hussey, S W",The suitability of sand abstraction systems for community-managed domestic water supplies.,"This paper will discuss the system of abstracting water from the underlying water-bearing sediment of surface dry river beds. The technology is well established in Zimbabwe and is a valuable method of obtaining water for human consumption as well as for both livestock and irrigation use. Within Zimbabwe the system is erroneously but commonly, referred to as ""sand abstraction"". Apart from traditional methods there are several systems of sand abstraction which have been developed. Each method is dependant on equipment which can be installed into river sands which retain water. Systems range from large mechanized schemes to small scale, hand-operated pump and well screen units. The author, through his work and experience in this area has come to believe that small scale units which can be operated and sustained by local communities are the best option for reliable sources of clean water. In large rivers the sediment frequently retains a perennial supply of water and during a dry-season can provide many thousands of kilolitres of water. The river sands act as a huge, slow sand-filtration system and invariably yield water which is neither contaminated by poor sanitation nor by unpalatable mineral salts. Tests undertaken on water samples drawn from river sands have indicated that contamination occurs only after abstraction from containers. Water utilised from such sources is thus particularly suitable for both primary and secondary purposes. Where such systems can be established on low river banks, not too distant from the river edge, simple sand abstraction units provide an excellent, low cost method of abstracting water. Such systems are particularly appreciated by women who prefer small, low technology installations which they can operate themselves and can maintain simply and effectively.","Schriftenreihe des Vereins fur Wasser-, Boden- und Lufthygiene",105,,,153,8,,,,,,,,0300-8665,,MEDLINE:10842808

Soils consisted of layers of fluvially deposited, organic-rich silts, interstratified with fluvial and aeolian sands. The most significant influence of the ephemeral hydrologic regime upon soils was related to the downstream alluviation associated with hydrologic decay. This alluviation increased the silt proportion of soils in the lower reaches of the rivers. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous were correlated with silt content, and silt deposition patterns influenced patterns of moisture availability and plant rooting, creating and maintaining micro-habitats for various organisms. Localized salinization occurred in association with wetland sites and soluble salt content tended to increase downstream. Because of the covariance between silt and macronutrients, and the influence of silt upon moisture availability and habitat suitability, alluviation patterns associated with the hydrologic regime strongly influence the structure, productivity, and spatial distribution of biotic communities in ephemeral river ecosystems.

Biogeochemistry,2000,"Jacobson, PJ; Jacobson, KM; Angermeier, PL; Cherry, DS",Variation in material transport and water chemistry along a large ephemeral river in the Namib Desert,"1. The chemical characteristics of floodwaters in ephemeral rivers are little known, particularly with regard to their organic loads. These rivers typically exhibit a pronounced downstream hydrological decay but few studies have documented its effect on chemical characteristics and material transport. To develop a better understanding of the dynamics of floods and associated material transport in large ephemeral rivers, floods of the ephemeral Kuiseb River in south-western Africa were tracked and repeatedly sampled at multiple points along the river's lower 220 km.2. We quantified the composition and transport of solute and sediment loads in relation to longitudinal hydrological patterns associated with downstream hydrological decay. Source and sink areas for transported materials were identified, and the composition and transport dynamics of the organic matter load were compared to those described from more mesic systems.3. Concentrations of sediments and solutes transported by floods in the Kuiseb River tended to increase downstream in association with pronounced hydrological decay. The contribution of particulate organic matter to total organic load is among the highest recorded, despite our observation of unusually high levels of dissolved organic matter. Hydrological decay resulted in deposition of all transported material within the lower Kuiseb River, with no discharge of water or materials to the Atlantic Ocean.4. Our results suggest that longitudinal variation in surface flow and associated patterns of material transport renders the lower Kuiseb River a sink for materials transported from upstream. The downstream transport and deposition of large amounts of labile organic matter provides an important carbon supplement to heterotrophic communities within the river's lower reaches.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,44,3,,481,491,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00604.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000088556500010
Assessment,2000,"Jenkins, MA; Parker, GR","The response of herbaceous-layer vegetation to anthropogenic disturbance in intermittent stream bottomland forests of southern Indiana, USA","Between 1993 and 1995 we sampled herbaceous layer vegetation on 84 plots in Platanus/Asarum Wet-Mesic Bottomland forests to determine how these forests have responded to human disturbance. Four different disturbance types were sampled (abandoned agricultural are as, clearcuts, group-selection openings, and single-tree selection openings), and uncut 80-100 year-old reference stands were sampled for comparison. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), distance analyses (chord distance and normalized Euclidean distance) and similarity analysis (Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient) suggest that agricultural use has shifted herbaceous-layer vegetation composition away from that typical of the reference forests, but that clearcutting. group-selection harvest, and single-tree selection harvest have not greatly shifted herbaceous composition. This shift in vegetation on abandoned agricultural land resulted from a loss of indicator species, such as Cardamine concatenata (Michx.) Sw., Stellaria pubera Michx., and Laportea canadensis (L.) Weddell and an influx of disturbance, exotic, and nonforest species (e.g., Lycopodium complanatum L., Lonicera japonica Thunb. and Senecio aureus L.). However, only two species found in reference stands, Erigenia bulbosa (Michx.) Nutt. and Sphenopholis obtusata (Michx.) Scribn., were missing from clearcuts, group-selection openings, and single-tree selection openings. The species richness values of abandoned agriculture, clearcut, and group-selection plots were generally greater than those of single-tree selection and reference plots. Abandoned agricultural areas had much greater total species richness because of the influx of dry-site, exotic, disturbance, and non-forest species.",PLANT ECOLOGY,151,2,,223,237,,10.1023/A:1026575219518,,,,,,1385-0237,,WOS:000166537600009
"Fish, Assessment",2000,"Labbe, TR; Fausch, KD",Dynamics of intermittent stream habitat regulate persistence of a threatened fish at multiple scales,"Traditionally, threatened species management has emphasized conservation of individual populations and has assumed that abundance within suitable habitats is primarily governed by local environmental factors. However, recent research has revealed that landscape-level processes such as disturbance, dispersal, and habitat patch mosaic structure may also strongly influence local populations. We studied the population and habitat dynamics of a threatened fish, the Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini) at four spatial scales (pool, reach, segment, watershed) in two intermittent Colorado plains streams. At each scale, information on hydrology; habitat, and fish populations was combined to evaluate factors influencing darter persistence. At the pool scale, Arkansas darters persisted in most permanent pools during summer drought, tolerated extremes of hyperthermia and hypoxia, and were extirpated only when pools dried. Deeper pools had a higher probability of persisting during summer drought. At the reach scale, survival measured during an intensive mark-recapture study was high in a stenothermal spring pool, but low in associated downstream pools that froze during winter and had harsh, variable thermal regimes during summer. However, juvenile darters hatched earlier, grew faster, and were relatively more abundant in the warmer downstream pools compared to juveniles in the spring pool, where older fish dominated. Movement rates between the two habitats were relatively low, but adult darters were more mobile, dispersing out of the spring pool in early spring and returning upstream before the onset of summer drought. At the segment scale, flow variation among seasons and years controlled habitat connectivity, thereby affecting dispersal and reproduction and shaping the distribution and age composition of darter populations. At the watershed scale, nonnative northern pike (Esox lucius) preyed on darters, reducing their distribution and abundance in 13 km of Big Sandy Creek and isolating upstream darter populations from those downstream. Large floods scoured new spring-pool refugia and filled other pools, altering the mosaic of physical habitats. A comprehensive picture of factors controlling Arkansas darter populations and their habitat emerged only when physical and biotic processes were integrated across all four scales. To be effective, recovery efforts for species inhabiting variable environments must consider multiple scales, from landscape-level processes that create and maintain refugia to fine-scale factors that regulate the abundance and persistence of local populations.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10,6,,1774,1791,,10.2307/2641238,,,,,,1051-0761,,WOS:000165680300016
Invertebrate,2000,"Lake, PS","Disturbance, patchiness, and diversity in streams","Perturbations in ecosystems consist of a sequence of 2 events: the disturbance, marked by the application of the disturbing forces, and the response shown by the biota to the damage inflicted by the disturbance. The disturbance must be effectively characterized, without confounding it with the response, for progress to be made in the study of the disturbance ecology of streams. A disturbance may take the form of a pulse, a press, or a ramp, and the consequent trajectory of the response may be a purse, a press, or a ramp.Floods and droughts are the major forms of natural disturbance in Bowing waters and, although the effects of floods have been relatively well studied, those of droughts have been largely neglected. Floods accentuate downstream and lateral transport links, often with damaging consequences, whereas droughts fragment the continuity of streams. Both floods and droughts destroy and generate habitat patchiness and patchiness of the biota. During recovery, there are changes in the biotic composition and spatial configuration in patches. Resistance and resilience of the biota to disturbance may be facilitated by the use of refugia. The characterization of flood refugia is much more advanced than that of drought refugia.Recovery from floods is marked by the rapid attainment of relatively constant levels of diversity at the local scale of individual patches. At the regional scale of streams and their catchments, several studies have reported negative correlations between diversity and levels of flood disturbance, whereas other studies have reported unimodal diversity-disturbance curves consistent with patterns expected of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Such a unimodal relationship may be generated in several ways that await testing. In flowing waters at the regional scale, disturbance may play a central role in regulating species diversity. A predicted increase in the severity and frequency of disturbances with global climate change requires a comprehensive understanding of the disturbance ecology of running waters.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,19,4,,573,592,,10.2307/1468118,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000166307900001

Fifty-five species were collected (i.e. 22 mayflies, 14 stoneflies and 19 blackflies species) in 18 sampling sites located in both main streams and tributaries of the Sebaou river (Great Kabylie, North Algeria). Analysis of species diversity of the three considered taxa showed an altitudinal gradient with maximal diversity in the piedmont and low altitude mountain areas (from 200 to 500 m), which provided the most heterogeneous habitats to the benthic fauna. In contrast, the low diversity of the lowland sites was due to high water temperatures, reduced summer discharge and anthropogenic disturbances. In the same way, the low diversity of the high mountain areas can be attributed either to low water temperatures or high fluctuation in daily temperature. Three species assemblage groups are revealed, the first two are related to an upstream-downstream gradient, with headwater sites characterised by stoneflies species and middle stream sites by a high mayfly and blackfly diversity and abundance. The third group was identified as spring sites characterised by a low abundance and occurrence of stonefly species.Both altitudinal species diversity gradient and species assemblage of the Sebaou wadi were different from European and temperate areas, revealing that the accentuated North African Mediterranean climate could induce changes to both species and community structure.

To determine their biotic and abiotic effects, substrate composition, organic detritus abundance, and aquatic animal taxonomic richness and abundance were measured 8-16 d before and 7 d after a flash flood in a 122 m reach of a montane desert stream (Chihuahuan Desert, USA). The flash flood severely altered channel morphology by scouring and depositing substrates, but it did not change the overall abundance of any substrate particle size class. The flood removed most coarse detritus from the stream reach, although the quantity of organic particles <2 mm was unchanged. High losses were observed in most animal taxa (95 % overall), and reach-wide taxonomic richness was reduced from 35 to 21 taxa. Ephemeroptera were entirely eliminated from the study reach. The taxon experiencing the lowest percent loss (the belostomatid hemipteran Abedus herberti, 14 % loss) is known to possess behavioral mechanisms for flash flood avoidance. Compared to studies of flooding in mesic streams, this study suggests that flash floods in montane desert streams cause greater mortality in animal populations and remove more detritus. Ecologically, these high local mortality rates stress the importance of recolonization mechanisms.

Fish,2000,"Mankin, KR",An integrated approach for modelling and managing golf course water quality and ecosystem diversity,"Models can help planners assess the potential impacts of planned land development. However, pollutant yield results from common watershed water quality models are inadequate and must be coupled with other important ecosystem component models to assess the overall impact of land development and management. For example, golf course development typically replaces agricultural or native lands with intensively managed grassland with potential impacts on water quality, as well as avian and aquatic species habitat. An integrated modelling concept was demonstrated using readily available models and data for a hypothetical golf course within the Little Kitten Creek Watershed near Manhattan, KS, USA. A watershed water quality model (EUTROMOD) combined with local fish habitation data and habitat suitability index modelling was used to simulate the overall ecosystem impact of projected golf course design and management actions. Models were calibrated using data for grass and native prairie conditions, and future scenarios were simulated to guide design and management actions. Compared with the native conditions, good golf course management was simulated to increase annual nitrogen (N) yield by 148% and phospohorus (P) yield by 24% with little impact on runoff or erosion, while a poor management scenario increased the N yield by 380%. This change in aquatic nutrient levels along with concurrent projected changes in stream habitat led to a potential impact on three of four fish species analyzed. Avain habitat was also impacted depending upon design and management of non-playing area. An overall design and management plan was developed with the goal of maintaining predevelopment levels of water quality and habitat. Sustainable water quality management must include proper soil and water conservation, irrigation scheduling, and fertilizer and pesticide management. Appropriate features must be designed into numerous contiguous area (1.2 ha minimum for grassland and 0.8 ha minimum for woodland) of non-playing area trough, riparian area, etc.) to meet avian habitat needs. And a diversity of stream habitat conditions must be maintained, including clear pool and gravel-substrate riffle zones, and permanent and intermittent streams. This integrated modelling approach demonstrated the utility of a simplistic framework for analyzing and assessing ecosystem impacts of land development. Further work should integrate and test more complex models and interrelationships between models for lands undergoing a variety of ecosystem changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Sauer has a summer-dry temporary now regime. The seasonal dry phase: can last from spring to early autumn, so the duration of the dry phase varies from one to several months, increasing with distance downstream from the upstream permanent section. The number of invertebrate taxa and individuals decreases with increasing duration of the dry phase. The permanent section is characterized by taxa typical of montane and submontane streams, whereas the fauna of the temporary section is quite different, composed of representatives of various zonal areas. Limnephilid caddisflies are particularly characteristic of this section. Life cycle strategies and specific adaptations with respect to habitat drying are discussed for several species.

After the burn days with measurable flow increased to 255 days yr(-1) for all years (n=9) and to 225 days yr(-1) in years with below normal precipitation (n=4). Annual runoff coefficients in Tharp's Creek prior to the burn ranged from 0.005 to 0.20 during dry years and from 0.30 to 0.55 during wet years. Runoff coefficients in the Log Creek catchment ranged from 0.20 to 0.48 during dry years and from 0.60 to 0.80 during wet years.

In the control catchment, Log Creek, runoff did not increase significantly in the post-fire period.

Uncertainty over the management of headwater areas and potential effects on sensitive species has led to our Riparian Buffer Study. Four integrated studies are being conducted within the experimental treatments of the ""Density Management Studies"" J. Tappeiner et al. (in this proceedings) to provide information to aid riparian reserve width decisions when forest thinning is conducted in headwaters. Pretreatment surveys to characterize 40 to 70 years-old managed Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest communities in latitudinal (perpendicular to) and longitudinal (along) profiles to streams have yielded new information about habitats and species conditions in unthinned managed headwater subdrainages.First, microsites and microclimates are being examined in transects perpendicular to streams. Pre-treatment results of these intact young stands show: 1) macroclimate conditions associated with site locations, versus microsite features such as vegetation and topography, often account for the majority of the variation observed in microclimate; 2) microsite conditions tend to be different within the first 15 m from streams, and rapidly approximate upland forest conditions at distances beyond about 15 m; 3) light levels are low and are often likely to be a limiting factor for understory development and 4) large woody debris is in primarily advanced decay stages, and little recruitment is occurring. These pre-thinning results provide a reference against which post-harvest impacts will be evaluated.Second, stream habitats and their fish and amphibian fauna are being characterized at our managed forest headwater sites before thinning treatments are installed. The 15 species found in and along headwater streams sort into multiple distinct faunal assemblages, associated with different headwater microhabitats. Upslope, >2m from water, the assemblages collapse to primarily 2 amphibian species. Most relevant for headwater stream management in western Oregon forests is that torrent salamanders (under status review for United States Threatened and Endangered listing) are associated with discontinuous channels, the most frequent stream type at our headwater sites. Riparian management approaches (e.g., buffers, leave areas, harvest treatments) are recommended to identify and manage habitats of these critical populations in the uppermost headwaters.Third, forest arthropod diversity of headwater areas is under investigation. Aquatic insect assemblages are compared between perennial and ephemeral stream segments (emergence traps). Terrestrial arthropod assemblages are compared between riparian zone, the upslope ""ecological break"" (interface between streamside and upland), and upland forest habitat (pitfall traps). The abundance of aquatic insects was greatest in ephemeral reaches due to higher numbers of Diptera (flies) ephemeral streams appear to play a disproportionately important role in forest aquatic ecology relative to this taxa. However, arthropod diversity was greater in perennial streams. Perpendicular to streams, terrestrial arthropod abundance was greater in riparian zones, where unique species occurrence was highest as well. Our pre-treatment results show that all species characteristic of the forest floor may be preserved within the riparian zone.Fourth, lichens and bryophytes also are being examined in these managed forest stands. Diversity and abundance ""hotspots"" of these taxa are associated with managed forest microhabitats including riparian areas, hardwood gaps, remnant trees, and wolf trees. Our hypothesis is that creative thinning practices that preserve these habitat features can promote lichen/bryophyte species richness and abundance. This hypothesis is being tested in the BLM Density Management project, which places 1/4 to 1 acre leave-islands around these features within an upslope thinning treatment. The responses of these taxa to various thinning densities also is being examined, through analysis of selected species' growth rates and pre- and post-thinning analyses of their communities.In summary, pre-treatment findings from our integrated studies indicate:Across all taxa, species thought to be associated with. late-successional, old-growth forest conditions are being found in our managed forest sites.The near-stream environment in headwater landscapes is distinct from upslope areas relative to microsite and microclimate, and amphibian and arthropod diversity.The array of water flow patterns in headwaters creates a complex habitat mosaic, in which unique arthropod and amphibian assemblages are found in the uppermost segments of the stream network.Lichen and bryophyte diversity hotspots are tied to habitat features including riparian areas, hardwood gaps, remnant and wolf trees.Under investigation are: 1) conservation of the integrity of near-stream and instream habitats and fauna with alternative Riparian Buffer widths in a thinning matrix; and 2) conservation of upslope habitats for biodiversity with alternative thinning densities, and creative thinning designs including patch upslope reserves (leave islands).","PORTLAND'99: PIONEERING NEW TRAILS, PROCEEDINGS",,,,539,540,,,,1999 Society-of-American-Foresters National Convention on Pioneering New Trails,"SEP 11-15, 1999",Soc Amer Foresters,"PORTLAND, OR",,*************,WOS:000089530500097
Assessment,2000,"Perona, R; Tardiff, M; Michael, D; McFarland, T",The influence of fluvial geomorphology and particle size on health risk,"Risk assessments involving contaminated sediments sometimes neglect the influence that geomorphological processes may have on the spatial distribution of contamination. In the arid southwest of the United States, sediment particles in ephemeral stream systems are sorted by water flow into a mosaic of distinct geomorphological features, often with different characteristic particle size fractions. Contaminant concentrations, as well as intake via a variety of exposure pathways, may be correlated with particle size. In a recent investigation of a stream system impacted by mining operations, a sampling design based on fluvial geomorphology was used to collect data for risk assessment purposes. Chemical concentration data for differ ent particle size fractions were obtained within geomorphological features over several miles of an ephemeral stream. Several exposure pathways were employed to evaluate the potential significance of particle size and geomorphological sorting on risk estimates.",ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND MANAGEMENT OF WASTE IN ENERGY AND MINERAL PRODUCTION,,,,57,63,,,,6th International Conference on Environmental Issues and Management of Waste in Energy and Mineral Production (SWEMP 2000),"MAY 30-JUN 02, 2000",,"CALGARY, CANADA",,90-5809-085-X,WOS:000088357300011

Differences in growth and reproductive biology in three tributaries (Xevora, Caia and Degebe) were examined. L. pyrenaicus contributed up to 12% by number to the fish community, although each population was dominated by small individuals. Males up to five years of age and females up to seven years were caught. Females attained a greater size and age than males. The fastest growth rate was found in the Xevora river, where this species dominated the community structure and its ""preferred"" habitat characteristics were evident, i.e., moderately flowing water and coarse substrate. Changes in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) for sexually mature males and females suggest that gonad maturation occurs from October to April, and the spawning period is between April and July. Females from the Xevora river were more fecund and this was linked to the less harsh conditions found in this river.

Macroinvertebrate data and environmental information were collected at seven sites from three tributaries in the middle reaches of the Guadiana River, approximately every 3 months from April 1995 to April 1997. Despite considerable annual variation in discharge (related to duration of flood and drought periods), the number of macroinvertebrates found was consistently high. Diptera represented the major proportion of the benthic fauna (73.2%) followed by Ephemeroptera (10.3%), Coleoptera (4.1%) and Trichoptera (3.1%). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to evaluate the relationships between taxa density and habitat variables. Generally, Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera were found in the upstream sampling sites. Wider and deeper sites were associated with the presence of Diptera and were least diverse. High values for both the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the average score per taxon were usually found at upstream sites where Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera predominated.

"Fish, Assessment",2000,"Puckridge, JT; Walker, KF; Costelloe, JF",Hydrological persistence and the ecology of dryland rivers,"The flow regime of Cooper Creek, central Australia, is subject to a summer-monsoonal climate and aseasonal cycles associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Analysis of a 48-year hydrograph indicates that floods tend to occur in clusters associated with La Nina episodes. The influence of ENSO is apparent in lagged correlations between discharge and values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and in measures of coherency derived from cross-spectrum analysis. Hydrological persistence is indicated by partial auto-correlations between floods in successive years. In a cluster of five floods over 1987-1991, cumulative effects were apparent in wetland habitat areas, in water temperature and transparency, and in the recruitment patterns of five fish species: Nematalosa erebi (Clupeidae), Hypseleotris klunzingeri (Gobiidae), Melanotaenia splendida tatei (Melanotaeniidae), Retropinna semoni (Retropinnidae) and Gambusia holbrooki (Poeciliidae). During serial floods, native fish appear to have a recruitment advantage over the exotic Gambusia.

Contamination of groundwater from one of the French wells near Sabarmati railway bridge was noticed in 1992. The suspected pollution sources are Duff-nala of Shahibaug and two other sources from slum dwellings on either side of Sabarmati river. A combined groundwater flow, pathlines and a mass transport model was constructed covering an area of 9 km(2) to analyse the capture zone of the French well under two different scenarios. Aquifer parameters of the river bed aquifer were available. Dry river bed condition was simulated under scenario I and controlled flow in the river bed was simulated under scenario II. The groundwater velocity and migration of contaminant particles from sources was analysed in the pathline model. Total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration contours originating from sources in the mass transport model (MT3D) were computed by solving an advection-dispersion equation. The computed pathlines and TDS concentration contours indicate likely migration of contaminant plume from pollutant sources to the French well during 365 days under two scenarios. The model results confirm the tracer injection studies carried out to know the likely migration of contaminants towards the French well.

A. hispanica occurs mainly in smaller streams with high dissolved oxygen concentrations (>9 mg/L), coarse substratum (gravels and cobbles), shallow depth (<60 cm), and a water temperature below 25<degrees>C. The species is short lived (maximum three years old) achieving a small size (<60 mm fork length) with rapid growth (<approximate to>40 mm) to maturity in its first year of life, and little growth thereafter (10-15 mm/yr). The species spawns for the first time early in its second year of life (April-May period). Owing to the different maturing oocyte sizes in ovaries, it seems to be a fractional spawner, laying a small number of oocytes (<100) in each batch. The species has adopted a 'r' selected life history strategy to survive the variability of the environmental conditions prevalent in intermittent streams. However, alterations to habitat, flow regime through abstraction and river regulation, pollution and the introduction of exotic fish species have contributed to the demise of the species across its natural range in southern Iberia. Concerted action is needed to conserve the few remaining habitats where the species survives, and rehabilitation of the degraded rivers where the species used to exist is discussed.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,149,4,,569,586,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000165691300003

Invertebrates and physicochemical parameters were sampled during 9 months to assess temporal changes in biotic and abiotic variables. Macroinvertebrate densities decreased following either a high-flow or a stream drought. Three invertebrate assemblages were identified via PCA and cluster analysis. PCA ordination showed a temporal sequence between the sampling dates. A low flow association occurred in August, a period of rewetting after the stream drought in late July. A high-flow association was established by sampling dates (September and November) with the highest flows registered during the study, and an intermediate-flow association occurred during the longer dry period after the rainy season. The low-flow group was dominated by the Philopotamidae (65%). The intermediate-flow group showed a more even distribution of macroinvertebrate abundances. The high-flow group was dominated by Philopotamidae, Leptophlebiidae, Chironomidae and Baetidae. The lowest richness and highest density values were observed for the low-flow group. Average physicochemical parameters also were different between the PCA groups. A gradient of physicochemical parameters was observed from the ""low-flow"" group to the ""high-flow"" group. Temporal flow changes probably structure macroinvertebrate communities during extreme episodes of drought or spates, but during intermediate flow periods some biotic processes may determine community structure.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,148,3,,421,432,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000087780800006

The V-max (maximal velocity), K-m (apparent Michaelis constant) and T-t (turnover time of substrate hydrolysis) were obtained for the beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase and phosphatase activities by the Michaelis-Menten approach. V-max values were always higher for the cyanobacterial crust in La Solana (an open stream) - 33.8-130.8 for beta-glucosidase, 27.9-114.9 for beta-xylosidase, 75.1-240.5 for phosphatase - than for the sandy and epilithic biofilms in Riera Major (a forest stream)- 5.4-18.1 and 12.6-15.9 for beta-glucosidase, 2.4-5.7 and 8.6-8.7 for beta-xylosidase, 10.8-36.6 and 80.1-81.1 for phosphatase for sandy and epilithic biofilms, respectively. When normalized to biofilm biomass, the V-max were still higher in La Solana. K-m values were in the same range in the two streams. However, the turnover times were much lower in La Solana than in the epipsammic and epilithic biofilms of Riera Major. Such differences might be related to the different composition and structure in each biofilm as well as to the different environmental parameters (canopy, light, DOC content) in each stream. The rapid recycling of the organic matter in La Solana might be caused by the more labile substrates for the heterotrophs (organic compounds from primary producers), while the slower turnover time in Riera Major might be a result of it receiving an input of more recalcitrant material (litter fall from the riparian vegetation). The different nature of autochthonous biomass may also cause the differences in enzyme activities between both streams.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,148,1,,99,117,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000086710000008

Results from canonical correlation analysis suggest that ionic content of the water and chlorophyll a content of biofilms (algal biomass) were the main factors accounting for the variability in extracellular enzyme activity of the biofilms in these streams. Water temperature was not an important factor accounting for differences among streams, while nutrient concentration played a role only in special situations such as periods when flow stops. Episodes of flow cessation and high discharge greatly affected the extracellular enzymatic activities. Biofilms differed in their efficiency in the use of polysaccharides (defined as the activity of beta -glucosidase and beta -xylosidase per bacterial cell). Biofilms at the site showing high nutrient concentrations (Ter River) were the least efficient, while those occurring at lower nutrient concentrations (La Solana and sandy sediments of Riera Major) were the most efficient. The highest efficiency was associated with stromatolitic communities in La Solana. The epilithic biofilms of Riera Major showed a lower efficiency than biofilms on sand in the same stream, suggesting that biofilm type may be another factor inducing variation in biofilm activity.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,62,3,,205,215,,10.1007/PL00001332,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000165184400002

The biofilms in these fluvial systems accounted for a wide range of bacterial and algal biomass and colonized the most common benthic habitats. Ratio of bacteria/algae biomass was lower in Atlantic than in Mediterranean streams, but enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, phosphatase) were in general greater in the Mediterranean stream biofilms. Climatic characteristics (especially temperature) may explain the differences in enzymatic activities between biofilms of similar structure but different flow regime. The ratio beta-xylosidase: beta-glucosidase was similar (around 0.5) for all streams and substrata considered, showing that there is a general higher utilization of cellobiosic than xylobiosic molecules in fluvial systems. In general, highly heterotrophic biofilms showed lower extracellular enzymatic activities than more autotrophic biofilms. Maximum enzymatic activity is achieved when the algal biomass is two- to threefold higher than the bacterial biomass. The relevance of algal biomass on the heterotrophic ability of biofilms may be related to the physical proximity between the two, but also to the high proportion of polymeric carbohydrates included in algal exudates and lysis products, whose use is enzyme-mediated.",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,40,1,,16,24,,,,,,,,0095-3628,,WOS:000089126900004

Hydrological change was assessed using simulated data from the Integrated Quantity and Quality Model (IQQM) and a range of relatively simple flow statistics: the annual proportional flow deviation; the frequencies of medium or high flow events; and the durations of low or no-now events. The changes in physical properties, water quality and biological characteristics within the six river systems were assessed from the literature and summarized. This information was used to construct a series of hypothetical curves (reference curves) summarizing ecological response to hydrological change. The suitability of these response curves was then checked using data from a seventh river, Cooper Creek, a relatively major pristine endorheic system in central Australia. Reference curves appear to be an effective tool for assessing the likely ecological responses of river systems to increased hydrological change.

Fish from the upper and lower basin of an Oklahoma prairie stream were sampled bi-weekly from 19 April to 12 October 1997. Along with condition factors of Campostoma anomalum (adults and juveniles), Etheostoma spectabile, and Notropis boops, growth rates of juvenile C. anomalum, and gonadal somatic indices (GSI) from adult C. anomalum were calculated. Individuals occupying the upper basin experienced the greatest environmental fluctuations, but also had condition factors that were similar or higher than conspecifics in the more stable lower basin for each species. Changes in length-frequency distributions suggested the existence of 2-3 cohorts and relatively rapid growth in the upper basin and a single slower-growing cohort in the lower basin. Additionally, reproductive styles, measured in terms of GSI and appearance of juveniles, varied among the two sites, suggesting that reproductive plasticity over small scales may result from the different environmental regimes of each stream segment. Overall results demonstrate that although large fluctuations in the environment may produce conditions that appear to be detrimental to an individual, in actuality, they may not be. In fact, areas with the largest environmental fluctuations produced robust individuals, and thus may offer some unseen benefit that counterbalances or outweighs the costs associated with a variable environment. Additionally, there is evidence that at least some resident taxa have sufficient life history plasticity to exploit these opportunities wherever or whenever they may arise.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,59,1,,99,109,,10.1023/A:1007630417266,,,,,,0378-1909,,WOS:000089120500013

Assessment,2000,"Tooth, S","Process, form and change in dryland rivers: a review of recent research","Many of the world's extensive warm dryland regions support numerous, albeit often infrequently flowing, rivers. Dryland rivers are increasingly a focus of scientific and applied interest but empirical research and fluvial theory for drylands need to be strengthened. Recent research in arid central Australia indicates greater diversity in dryland river process, form and change than has hitherto been appreciated, and highlights the need for a global review assessing the present state of knowledge. This review outlines the distinctive characteristics of dryland fluvial environments (hillslope and channel hydrological and sediment transport processes, river pattern and geometry, temporal and spatial aspects of channel change, sedimentary structures and bedforms), many of which contrast with more humid fluvial environments. Although features common to many dryland fluvial environments can be identified (extreme temporal and spatial variability of rainfall, runoff and sediment transport, poor integration between tributary and trunk channels, importance of large floods as a control on channel morphology, lack of equilibrium between process and form), the fluvial diversity that exists within drylands requires recognition of the limitations to these generalisations. In particular, research in central Australia illustrates the need to understand the rivers of this region using empirical relationships, terms, and concepts additional to those defined by earlier work in drylands. Key deficiencies in dryland fluvial research an identified, and relate to three main areas: Limited study of some aspects of modern dryland rivers (floodplain characteristics, influence of vegetation, downstream changes, importance of scale); limited understanding of dryland river behaviour over longer (Cenozoic) timescales; and lack of integration between the results from short-term, process-form studies and studies of the longer term histories of river behaviour. Linking knowledge of past hydrological and channel changes to present-day changes in dryland rivers is suggested as a key research priority. This will help develop a sound theoretical basis for the assessment of future developments in dryland river systems which will contribute to their improved scientific understanding and environmentally sensitive management.

The study was conducted over a three year period in Kakadu National Park, and employed a comparative catchment approach though without any pre-treatment data. The canopy cover, density of riparian vegetation, litter- and ground-cover of the catchment burnt early in the dry season (catchment E, stream E) and the unburnt catchment (catchment U, stream U) were similar. Fires lit late in the dry season (catchment L, stream L) however resulted in tree mortalities, and a lower canopy cover (50% less), riparian tree density (80% less) and litter cover, and increased amounts of bare ground; thereby increasing catchment L's susceptibility to erosion. This resulted in episodic runoff events from catchment L in November and December, before continuous wet season flow. These events, absent in catchments E and U, featured high concentrations of total suspended sediment (TSS). volatile suspended sediment (VSS), N, P, Fe and Mn up to 10 times those measured later in the wet season. During continuous wet season flow between December and June, baseflow water quality of the three streams were similar. Storm runoff concentrations for N and P were also similar, however stream L storm runoff concentrations of TSS, VSS, Fe and Mn were 2-5 times higher than those measured in streams E and U. Despite this, only the export coefficients for TSS from catchment L (average 61 kg ha(-1)) were significantly higher (average 2.4 times) than catchment E and U coefficients. This was attributed to the overwhelming influence of stream volume, relative to concentration in determining stream load and hence catchment export coefficients (load/catchment area). The apparently negligible impact of the fire regimes on VSS, N, P, Fe and Mn export coefficients, and also the overall low sediment export coefficients for the three catchments which were up to 100 times less than that reported for other tropical environments, were ascribed to the low catchment slopes (average 0.5%), low soil fertility, maintenance of a protective surface gravel lag, the negligible impact of the fire regimes on water yield, and the sometimes lengthy (maximum 6 months) period between burning and runoff.

Ephemeral sites had the highest DOC concentrations, and unragulated perennial sites had lower concentrations than unregulated intermittent sites, regulated sites, and sites downstream from wastewater-treatment plants (p < 0.05). Reservoir outflows and wastewater-treatment plant effluent were higher in DOC concentration (p < 0.05) and exhibited less variability in concentration than inflows to the reservoirs. Specific ultraviolet absorbance values at 254 nm were typically less than 2 m(-1)(milligram DOC per liter)(-1) and lower than values found in most temperate-region rivers, but specific ultraviolet absorbance values increased during runoff events. Fluorescence measurements indicated that DOC in desert streams typically exhibit characteristics of autochthonous sources; however, DOC in unregulated upland rivers and desert streams experienced sudden shifts from autochthonous to allochthonous sources during runoff events.

Assessment,2000,"Wijdenes, DJO; Poesen, J; Vandekerckhove, L; Ghesquiere, M",Spatial distribution of gully head activity and sediment supply along an ephemeral channel in a Mediterranean environment,"In this study, we examined the factors that control the spatial distribution of bank gully heads along a reach of an ephemeral river (Rambla Salada) in an area threatened by desertification in Southeast Spain. The activity of 458 gully heads was assessed in the field by pre-defined criteria such as sharp edges, presence of a plunge pool, tension cracks, recent deposited sediments, flow marks, and vegetation re-growth. The results showed that land use has a significant impact on bank gully head activity. Recent land-use changes involving the extension of almond cultivation appears to intensify bank gully head activity. Also, lithology has a clear impact on the bank gully extension. It was further investigated whether the gully heads were important sediment sources that contributed to reservoir sedimentation. The density of (very) active bank gully heads along the study reach was one per 17 m of channel length. Average annual retreat volumes were derived from measurements at 46 active gully heads (4.0 m(3) y(-1)). By selecting all the channel sections in the catchment of the Puentes Reservoir with a similar pattern of bank gullies using aerial photographs, an estimate of basin-wide sediment production of bank gully heads was established. It was estimated that the retreat of active bank gully heads alone in the 12,760 ha study area (representing 12% of the total catchment area of the Puentes Reservoir) produced 6% of the sediment filling up the reservoir. Considering that the sediment is also derived from other sources such as channel walls, channel beds, and hillslopes, the overall conclusion is that bank gully expansion in Southeast Spain is a major point source of sediment and therefore, a major process of land degradation.

Terrestrial invertebrates were collected from three sites on the Kruis River in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, using pitfall traps within the dry stream bed over summer months (Jan-Feb). 9848 individuals representing 19 different orders were collected. Taxa were separated and biomass determined for aerial and non-aerial invertebrates. Significantly greater (P < 0.05) numbers of aerial. than non-aerial taxa and individuals suggest that most individuals could use flight to escape the onset of surface flows. The absence of significant differences between the biomass (wet weights) of aerial and non-aerial individuals (P > 0.05) suggests, however, that a large proportion of the biomass is confined to the main channel. The inability of a large portion of the biomass to escape the onset of flow through the use of flight suggests that periodically inundated areas of the stream channel constitute an ecologically significant component of temporary stream ecosystems. The concept of the flood pulse should be expanded to include aseasonal and secular variations in flow which in temporary streams create lateral movements that provide the driving mechanism for the entrainment of organic material.",AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,35,2,,193,200,,,,,,,,1562-7020,,WOS:000169907400005

However, the best-developed stream-bed tufa deposits are located immediately upstream of dam and waterfall formations, which indicates that the evaporation of water ponded behind these flow obstructions may lead to calcium carbonate precipitation during the dry season. The presence of plant and cyanobacterial communities on, and the incorporation of organic material into, the best-developed tufa formations indicates that biological activity may have an important role to play in determining both the rate of tufa deposition and the internal structure of the resulting accumulations.",AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER,31,3,,333,347,,10.1080/713612249,,,,,,0004-9182,,WOS:000165787300006

Organisms were trees, shrubs, birds, insects extracted from the litter layer, and insects caught in pitfall traps. Each group was sampled using a standardized methodology, and the component taxa were counted and identified to a level commonly used in ecological studies of that organism - varying from species to order levels. Sites adjacent to drainage lines or ephemeral streams were biotically more similar to one another than they were to paired upslope sites 100-200 m distant and 15-35 m higher in altitude. This phenomenon occurred irrespective of the level of taxonomic resolution or type of organism. Within each taxonomic group, some components were mainly riparian, while others were more characteristic of upslope sites. Characteristically riparian taxa included trees in the genus Glochidion, the shrub genus Leptospermum, birds in the Pachycephalidae and Meliphagidae families, and litter invertebrates in the order Acarina. Upslope taxa included shrubs in the Rutaceae, birds in the Artamidae, and ants. Within the groups of trees, birds and litter invertebrates, more taxa were characteristic of riparian than upslope sites.

In the new master planned community of Fountain Hills, a residential area near Phoenix, Arizona developed since the 1970s, surveys in 1987 and 2001 of ephemeral wash channels show that they are larger than comparable channels in humid areas, reflecting the effects of rare but substantial floods. Morphological adjustment is spatially varied and is influenced by wide road crossings that are responsible for fragmentation of the adjusting channels into segments. By 2001, these segments are characterized by scour immediately downstream of a crossing and a relatively high width-depth ratio farther downstream before the next road crossing. Such spatially distributed responses have caused management problems unique to arid environments, so that, although road drainage was originally allowed to flow into the washes at the crossings, the stormwater network has now been augmented to improve drainage and to inhibit scour at the crossings. In maintaining such washes, consideration of channel adjustments as a result of urbanization could form the basis for an approach comparable to restoration methods in more humid areas.",ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,91,4,,595,608,,10.1111/0004-5608.00260,,,,,,0004-5608,,WOS:000173892600001
Assessment,2001,"Constantz, J; Stonestrom, D; Stewart, AE; Niswonger, R; Smith, TR",Analysis of streambed temperatures in ephemeral channels to determine streamflow frequency and duration,"Spatial and temporal patterns in streamflow are rarely monitored for ephemeral streams. Flashy, erosive streamflows common in ephemeral channels create a series of operational and maintenance problems, which makes it impractical to deploy a series of gaging stations along ephemeral channels. Streambed temperature is a robust and inexpensive parameter to monitor remotely, leading to the possibility of analyzing temperature patterns to estimate streamflow frequency and duration along ephemeral channels. A simulation model was utilized to examine various atmospheric and hydrological upper boundary conditions compared with a series of hypothetical temperature-monitoring depths within the streambed. Simulation results indicate that streamflow events were distinguished from changing atmospheric conditions with greater certainty using temperatures at shallow depths (e.g,, 10-20 cm) as opposed to the streambed surface. Three ephemeral streams in the American Southwest were instrumented to monitor streambed temperature for determining the accuracy of using this approach to ascertain the long-term temporal and spatial extent of streamflow along each stream channel. Streambed temperature data were collected at the surface or at shallow depth along each stream channel, using thermistors encased in waterproof, single-channel data loggers tethered to anchors in the channel.

A decreasing gradient of lignin phenols (from ca. 0.8 to 0.5 mg 100 mg OC-1) was observed downstream, together with an increase of p-hydroxyl (H) phenols. Seasonal variations in total and lignin-phenols composition were very noticeable and seemed to be connected directly to rainfall variations. Lignin-phenol concentrations were higher in the wet periods (up to 12.1 mug/1) while the dry periods were characterised by the predominance of H phenols over lignin-phenols (Lambda) (H/Lambda ratios reaching values of 245 during summer). This predominance of H phenols was also associated with high chlorophyll a concentrations, which may indicate an autochthonous (and fresher) source of these phenols to the water column. Mean vanillic acid/vanillin ratios were higher than those of fresh plant material (0.4 for POM against 0.2 for fresh plant tissues), indicating that the lignin component had already been degraded before entering the river. The syringyl/vanillyl (S/V) and cinnamyl/vanillyl (C/V) ratios indicate a predominance of angiosperm + gymnosperm woody material in the lower sector and the presence of some angiosperm non-woody material in the mountain sector. corresponding to alpine and sub-alpine vegetation.

We examined invertebrate assemblages in a perennial and an intermittent stream during summer baseflow conditions to determine if the direction of subsurface flow within each stream influenced taxonomic composition. The subsurface regions are described as 1) infiltration (where stream surface-water recharges the aquifer), 2) exfiltration (where interstitial water discharges into the stream surface), and 3) dry-channel subsurface region (i.e. the saturated interstices beneath a dry intermittent stream channel). In both perennial and intermittent streams, the infiltration regions had higher invertebrate densities, taxa richness, and chironomid densities, but a lower percentage of hypogean individuals. The direction of subsurface flow did not generally affect the distribution of the three hypogean taxa (Archiannelida, the amphipod Stygobromus, and the isopod Calasellus) in either stream.

Patch composition and configuration affects both the form of transported materials and the amount of nutrient retention and export. We describe spatial patterns of nutrients in the surface water of an arid-land stream using surveys conducted at 3 different scales, ranging from 30 m to 10 km in extent and from 1 m to 25 m in grain. We then relate these patterns to connections with subsurface patches at channel subunit, channel unit, and reach scales. Our objectives were to compare spatial variation in nutrients across scales, to determine the causes of downstream changes in nutrient concentration in terms of intervening patches, and to investigate whether subsurface patches at different scales behaved similarly in terms of net nutrient processing.Nutrients varied spatially at all scales sampled. The highest variation was observed in nitrate-N (NO3,-N) in the survey with the smallest grain (CV = 161%) and the lowest was observed ed in soluble reactive P (SRP) in the same survey (CV = 17%). We hypothesized that downstream changes in nutrient concentrations were caused by upwelling of high-nutrient water from the subsurface To test this hypothesis, we identified locations of hydrologic inputs to surface water from the subsurface using geomorphic features of the stream such as gravel bar edges (channel subunit scale), riffle-run transitions (channel unit scale), and permanent groundwater sources (reach scale). As surface water passed over these locations, nutrient concentrations generally increased, particularly during late succession when subsurface patches acted as sources of NO3-N at all 3 scales and as sources of SRP at the channel unit and reach scales. A hierarchical approach allowed us to decompose effects of subsurface upwellings at different scales and to consider interactions between them.

Assessment,2001,"Domingo, F; Villagarcia, L; Boer, MM; Alados-Arboledas, L; Puigdefabregas, J",Evaluating the long-term water balance of arid zone stream bed vegetation using evapotranspiration modelling and hillslope runoff measurements,"The difference between long-term actual evapotranspiration (AET) and precipitation (P) provides a useful indication of the extent to which a site retains or loses water resources, and therefore of the likely occurrence of specific land degradation processes. Sink areas (AET much greater than P) receive lateral water inputs from other parts of the catchment. In arid and semi-arid environments these areas are frequently found in, or next to, the stream beds of ephemeral rivers and are often characterised by intensive land use or high conservation values. For both types of land use it is important to know if, and how much, AET exceeds P, and where the lateral water inputs come from. Thick sedimentary fills in the stream bed, variable climate conditions and ephemeral flow conditions pose specific difficulties to the evaluation of the water balance of these sites. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to explore the relative importance of lateral water inputs to shrub stands growing in thick sedimentary fills of semi-arid ephemeral rivers. The approach is based on (i) estimating long-term AET - P balances in the channel sediments and (ii) assessing whether these inflows originate mainly from surrounding hillslopes or from the upstream part of the catchment. A physically based evapotranspiration model for sparse vegetation was used to estimate the long-term AET rates. The relative importance of hillslope runoff and channel flow was evaluated in a semi-quantitative fashion from a combination of surface area estimates and mostly published values of soil hydrological parameters. The approach was developed and tested in a selected stand of Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs in a stream bed at the Rambla Honda field site (Tabernas, Almeria, SE Spain). Predictions from the evapotranspiration model, which were found to be accurate during previous studies at Rambla Honda, show that actual evapotranspiration (AET) largely exceeds precipitation (P) at annual scales. The estimated deficit may be compensated by: (a) infiltration of local rainfall during extreme events; (b) runon from the surrounding hillslopes; or (c) infiltration of channel flow during flash floods originating from the upper part of the catchment. Results show that possibilities (a) and (b) cannot explain the water deficit. Deep storage of water during floods in the main channel, however, can be as much as 60-150 mm per event, and may have been 160-400 mm per year during the study period (1994-1997). This amount is large enough to replenish the annual deficit of ca. 100 mm per year found in the R. sphaerocarpa stand. These results imply that under current climate conditions land use changes in the upper sections of the Rambla Honda basin are more important for the persistence of the stream bed vegetation of our site than the land cover and runoff from surrounding hillslopes.

Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Simuliidae also were common and able to complete development in the temporary lake outlets. Cladocera and Copepoda originating from the lakes attained high abundances in some outlets regardless of being temporary or permanent. The harsh Alpine environment in concert with intermittency were strong determinants of ecosystem properties in the temporary outlets.

This change is reflected in many studies; work at Sycamore Creek in Arizona will be used to illustrate the challenges of this transition and several applications. Conceptual challenges involve clear determination of the organization of research objectives. Ecosystem science is largely concerned with how things work while landscape ecology focuses on the influence of spatial pattern and heterogeneity on system functioning. Questions of system scale, hierarchical structure, dimensionality, and currency must be resolved in order to productively execute research objectives. The new stream ecology is more. integrative, more realistic spatially, deals with streams at a larger scale, and treats them as branched system more than former approaches. At Sycamore Creek, studies of sand bar patches and their influence on organisms and nutrient cycling illustrate how variations in patch shape, and configuration can alter system outputs. Beyond sandbars, inclusion of riparian zones as integral parts of streams produces a more coherent view of nutrient dynamics than previous studies that began at the water's edge. Integration of streams with the landscape they drain requires that streams be viewed as branched structures, not linear systems. This view in ecology is in its infancy but it provides an opportunity to identify processing hot spots along flow paths and to reveal presumptive effects of climate change in terms of spatial shifts in biogeochemical activity rather than black-box rate changes.",SCIENTIA MARINA,65,,,181,192,,,,,,,,0214-8358,,WOS:000171462600014
Assessment,2001,"Hansen, WF",Identifying stream types and management implications,"Characteristics of stream types were surveyed within the Chattooga River watershed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of southeastern US. The 728 km(2) watershed is contained within the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The stream types of about 190 streams of various sizes were determined as perennial, intermittent or ephemeral using a combination of physical and biological indicators. The key indicators were defined as channel erosion into the landscape and aquatic insects. Comparisons were made between the measured stream characteristics and their hydrologic orders. The stream data indicated that most headwater order 1 streams were either ephemeral or intermittent. Order 2 streams were divided among intermittent, perennial and ephemeral. All order 3 streams and larger ones were perennial, except for one small, third order intermittent stream with an 18% channel gradient. The data suggest that the total 4670 km stream network was approximately equally divided between defined channels (28% perennial and 17% intermittent) and undefined channels (55% ephemeral). Changes in stream order produced exponential changes in the total number, mean segment length and total length of streams. The fine detail included about 15,630 order 1 channels with a combined length of 2740 km. Comparisons are provided between the estimated extent of stream types and the 'blue-line' streams identified on the US Geological Survey topographic contour maps at both 1:24,000 and 1:100,000 scales. Streams indicated on the 1:100,000 scale maps identified about 650 km of streams, while the 1:24,000 scale mapped the blue-line stream extent at 970 km. Of the estimated 1300 km of perennial streams, the topographic maps identified 50-75%, depending on scale. However, only about 14-21% of the entire stream network which includes perennial, intermittent and ephemeral streams were marked on the topographic contour maps. Recommendations are included for improving the consistency of how 'stream orders' and 'stream types' are delineated. Since water quality protection measures are often related to the stream type, improvement in identifying streams should improve stream protection design and help to prevent impacts on water quality and aquatic habitat.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2001,"Hassan, MA; Egozi, R",Impact of wastewater discharge on the channel morphology of ephemeral streams,"The impact of wastewater flow on the channel bed morphology was evaluated in four ephemeral streams in Israel and the Palestinian Territories: Nahal Og, Nahal Kidron, Nahal Qeult and Nahal Hebron. Channel changes before, during and after the halting of wastewater flow were monitored. The wastewater flow causes a shift from a dry ephemeral channel with intermittent floods to a continuous flow pattern similar to that of humid areas: Within a few months, nutrient-rich wastewater flow leads to rapid development of vegetation along channel and bars. The colonization of part of the active channel by vegetation increases flow resistance as well as bank and bed stability, and limits sediment availability from bars and other sediment stores along the channels. In some cases the established vegetation covers the entire channel width and halts the transport of bed material along the channel. During low and medium size flood events, bars remain stable and the vegetation intact. Extreme events destroy the vegetation and activate the bars. The wastewater flow results in the development of new small bars, which are usually destroyed by flood flows. Due to the vegetation establishment, the active channel width decreases by up to 700 per cent. The deposition of fine sediment and organic material changed the sediment texture within the stable bar surface and the whole bed surface texture in Nahal Hebron. The recovery of Nahal Og after the halting of the wastewater flow was relatively fast; within two flood seasons the channel almost returned to pre-wastewater characteristics. The results of the study could be used to indicate what would happen if wastewater flows were introduced along natural desert streams. Also, the results could be used to predict the consequences of vegetation removal as a result of human intervention within the active channel of humid streams.

More Japanese dace colonized the stream with shelters than without shelters. The standard length and condition of Japanese dace tended to be greater in the stream with shelters than without shelters. Foraging behavior and area of Japanese dace differed significantly between the two streams; more Japanese dace employing drift feeding near the entrance of the shelterless stream. Japanese dace predominantly fed upon chironomid larvae, which became abundant in stream mud in July. However, in August and September, Japanese dace rarely preyed upon chironomid larvae and their digestive canal fullness was low, probably because most chironomid larvae had been consumed. This tendency was more prominent in the stream with shelters. The use of temporary waters by Japanese dace changed dynamically in response to the abundance of chironomid larvae and the presence or absence of shelters.",FISHERIES SCIENCE,67,1,,36,45,,10.1046/j.1444-2906.2001.00196.x,,,,,,0919-9268,,WOS:000168221200006
Biogeochemistry,2001,"Killingbeck, KT; Whitford, WG","Nutrient resorption in shrubs growing by design, and by default in Chihuahuan Desert arroyos","In the northern stretches of the Chihuahuan Desert, the margins of ephemeral stream channels called arroyos support a unique vegetation dominated by a guild of winter-deciduous shrubs. To explore the dynamics of nutrient conservation in this assemblage of arroyo shrubs, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption efficiency and proficiency in six species of shrubs growing in arroyos in southern New Mexico, USA. Collectively, these six species were no more efficient or proficient at resorbing N and P from senescing leaves than shrubs growing in other environments. Resorption efficiency averaged 53% and 50% for N and P, respectively, and resorption proficiency averaged 0.80% and 0.06% for N and P, respectively. However, resorption varied significantly between species specifically restricted in their distribution to riparian habitats (obligate riparian species), and those that were not. The two obligate riparian species combined (Brickellia laciniata, Chilopsis linearis) were significantly more efficient and proficient at resorbing N than the non-obligate riparian species combined (Fallugia paradoxa, Flourensia cernua, Prosopis glandulosa, Rhus microphylla). Additionally, both Brickellia and Chilopsis were individually significantly more proficient at resorbing N than any of the other four species. The dichotomy in resorption between obligate riparian species and those that were not may have been the result of the interplay between hydrology, geomorphology, and biology. Because arroyos move in space as the movement of water erodes banks and changes channel location, some plants are found along arroyos only because the arroyos have moved to them. These plants (plants growing by default) may be less well adapted to arroyo margins than obligate riparian species (plants growing by design). Significant differences in resorption between obligate and non-obligate riparian species suggested that evolutionary history and habitat specificity may be added to the list of factors known to influence resorption. Selected life history traits of the six species did not appear to be related to any measure of resorption, but leaf surface area, specific leaf mass, and nutrient concentrations in green leaves were all correlated with resorption efficiency or proficiency in one or more species. The only species capable of symbiotic N fixation, Prosopis glandulosa, retained at least 2.3 times more N in its senesced leaves than any other species. Patterns of resorption in arroyo shrubs strongly indicated that efficiency and proficiency are fundamentally different, complementary measures of resorption.",OECOLOGIA,128,3,,351,359,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,WOS:000170499400006

Re-establishment of epilithic biofilm on the upper surfaces of mineral substrata was tracked in a shallow riffle between Sep. 1995 and Mar. 1996. Recolonization of these surfaces by macroinvertebrates was also followed, as was their benthic density. Post-drought abundance of biofilm and invertebrates was compared with that of the pre-drought year (Aug 1994-Mar 1995). We found that viable algal cells remained attached to the dry substratum despite 9 weeks of drying. On rewetting, these resistant benthic algal populations increased in biomass (evidenced by AFDM, chlorophyll density) and cell density, until a series of high flow events scoured the stones in winter 1995/1996. Spatial variation in the biofilm also existed: generally, algal biomass was higher on bedrock than on small or large stones. Recolonization of the previously dry stream bed by macro invertebrates was rapid; after 3 days of flow, 665 larvae/m(2), composed of a mean of 7.5 taxa, had been attained. The total numbers of invertebrates peaked 38 days after rewetting when a density of 2185 larvae/m(2) was found. This increase in abundance was mainly driven by the tanypod chironomid Zavrelimyia sp., which represented 56% of total numbers on day 38.

Fish,2001,"Medeiros, ESF; Maltchik, L",Fish assemblage stability in an intermittently flowing stream from the Brazilian semiarid region,"Flooding and drought are important hydrological disturbances occurring in intermittent streams located in semiarid regions. The present study aims to analyse the effects of flood and drought on the diversity and stability of an intermittent stream fish community from the Brazilian semiarid region over the 1996 hydrological cycle. Fourteen fish collections were conducted during the rewetting, wet and drying phases, and 808 individuals were collected. Diversity was measured by using Simpson's Index (S) and community stability was analysed by using the variation in the abundance, then tested by applying Kendall's (W) test of concordance over the relative abundance rankings. This test supplies information about the stability of communities by means of the concordance of rankings. A community that is stable or near equilibrium has more constant rankings of its constituent species compared with a fluctuating one. The diversity increased progressively during the rewetting phase (S = 0.480-0.693; coefficient of variation = 0.131), reached its highest values during the wet phase (S = 0.745-0.861; coefficient of variation = 0.072), and remained high during the drying phase, with a lower oscillation than in the other phases (S = 0.699-0.801; coefficient of variation = 0.050). The abundance per collection varied significantly (Kruskal- Wallis 6.94, P = 0.031) throughout the hydrological phases. The stability of the community was higher during the rewetting (W = 0.58, P < 0.001) and drying (W = 0.86, P < 0.001) phases than during the wet phase (W = 0.45, P = 0.1818). In the Brazilian semiarid region, flooding disrupted the stability of the fish community studied and increased the diversity, whereas the absence of floods (expressed by the drying phase) caused a higher stability of the fish community and led to less variation in diversity.",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,26,2,,156,164,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2001.01099.x,,,,,,1442-9985,,WOS:000167888900005

Biogeochemistry,2001,"Meixner, T; Fenn, M; Poth, M",Nitrate in polluted mountainous catchments with Mediterranean climates.,"The mountains of southern California receive some of the highest rates of nitrogen (N) deposition in the world (approximately 40 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). These high rates of deposition have translated into consistently high levels of nitrate (NO3-) in some streams of the San Bernardino Mountains. However, not all streams are exhibiting these high levels of NO3-. Perennial streams have high NO3- concentrations (approximately 200 micromoles l(-1)) while ephemeral streams do not (approximately 20 micromoles l(-1)). This difference points to groundwater as the source of the NO3- observed in streams. Furthermore, the evidence indicates a differential impact of N deposition on terrestrial and aquatic systems in Mediterranean climates, with aquatic systems being impacted more quickly. The primary reason for this difference involves the asynchrony between the time that atmospheric deposition occurs (summer), the time period of maximum soil NO3- availability and leaching (winter), and the time of maximum plant N demand (spring). Our results indicate that semiarid Mediterranean climate systems behave differently from more humid systems in that, because of this asynchrony, aquatic systems may not be indicative of changes in terrestrial ecosystem response. These differences lead us to the conclusion that the extrapolation of impacts from humid to Mediterranean climates is problematic and the concept of N saturation may need to be revisited for semiarid and seasonally dry systems.",TheScientificWorldJournal,1 Suppl 2,,,564,71,,,,,,,,1537-744X,,MEDLINE:12805811

Air dried leaves (3g) of Phragmites australis were used in both watercourses while Populus alba leaves were studied in the Ebro river only, and Populus nigra leaves and a submerged rooted macrophyte (stems and leaves), Potamogeton coloratus, were studied only in the Senia stream. Litter bags of 100 Lm and 1 mm mesh size were collected on days 0, 3, 15, 30, 90 and 120 and 5 mm mesh bags were sampled once after 30 days. Macroinvertebrates inside the leaf bags were retrieved and ash free dry weight and carbon and nitrogen contents of the remaining detritus were determined. Litter decomposition rates, k, were estimated using a simple exponential model. No significant differences in decomposition rates were observed between 100 mum and 1 mm mesh bags. In 100 urn litter bags, decomposition of P. nigra leaves from the Senia stream (0.0104 day(-1)) was faster than that of P. alba leaves from the Ebro river (0.0049 day(-1)) (ANCOVA, p < 10(-5)). The decomposition rate of P. australis was higher in the Ebro river (0.009 +/- 0.002 day(-1)) than in the Senia stream (0.0056 +/- 0.0004 day(-1)) for the first 30 days of decomposition, but no differences were observed from day 30 onwards. The number of macroinvertebrates increased over time and were mainly collectors-gatherers of the genus Chironomus.

We studied whole-ecosystem metabolism in eight streams from several biomes in North America to identify controls on the rate of stream metabolism over a large geographic range. The streams studied had climates ranging from tropical to cool-temperate and from humid to arid and were all relatively uninfluenced by human disturbances.2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined using the open-system, two-station diurnal oxygen change method.3. Three general patterns in metabolism were evident among streams: (1) relatively high GPP with positive NEP (i.e. net oxygen production) in early afternoon, (2) moderate primary production with a distinct peak in GPP during daylight but negative NEP at all times and (3) little or no evidence of GPP during daylight and a relatively constant and negative NEP over the entire day.4. Gross primary production was most strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A multiple regression model that included log PAR and stream water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration explained 90% of the variation in log GPP.5. Ecosystem respiration was significantly correlated with SRP concentration and size of the transient storage zone and, together, these factors explained 73% of the variation in R. The rate of R was poorly correlated with the rate of GPP.6. Net ecosystem production was significantly correlated only with PAR, with 53% of the variation in log NEP explained by log PAR. Only Sycamore Creek, a desert stream in Arizona, had positive NEP (GPP: R>1), supporting the idea that streams are generally net sinks rather than net sources of organic matter.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,46,11,,1503,1517,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00773.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000172341400007

The tributaries Xevora, Caia and Degebe were sampled approximately every three months from April 1995 to April 1997. B. microcephalus attained a greater size (TL = 256 mm) and age (8 years) than B. steindachneri (TL = 218 turn and 5 years). The diet of both species was characterised by the presence of plant material (particularly algae), dipteran larvae and sediment. Trichopteran larvae and Ephemeroptera nymphs were also important (especially for B. microcephalus). Seasonal differences in diet were found, particularly for small specimens and B. steindachneri. Ontogenic shifts in diet were found in both species, expressed mainly as a gradual increase with fish size in the proportion of plant material and sediment. Dipteran larvae were abundant, but their importance declined with increasing size. Generally, seasonal overlap in diet was low, suggesting the partition of food resources to avoid competition. In conclusion, although B. microcephalus appear to grow faster and live longer than B. steindachneri, the trophic interaction of the two species appears well balanced and adapted to coexistence.",FOLIA ZOOLOGICA,50,4,,291,304,,,,,,,,0139-7893,,WOS:000173338800005

The study was carried out during a period without natural flood disturbances. Displacement of wood downstream was minimal. Wood accumulation in the streambed was 0.091 kg DW m(-2) y(-1), 83 % of which was smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. Large wood debris was absent due to the youth of the riparian forest (16-y-old Platanus x hispanica plantation with some Alnus glutinosa). The wood remaining in the streambed was not sufficient to retain litterfall during most of the year, except when the stream dried out (July-September). Wood debris in the streambed accounted for 9-14 % of the total debris inputs, the remainder corresponding to leaf litter. Leaf litter input in the streambed via direct fall derived solely from alder and accounted for 0.491 kg DW m(-2) y(-1). Lateral 2 1 litterfall inputs were due to both alders and sycamores (0.308 and 0.022 kg DW m(-2) y(-1) respectively), and accounted for 40 % of the total litterfall.

Biogeochemistry,2001,"Schade, JD; Fisher, SG; Grimm, NB; Seddon, JA",The influence of a riparian shrub on nitrogen cycling in a Sonoran Desert stream,"Riparian zones often act as nutrient filters, removing NO3 from water flowing through riparian soils. The role of vegetation in NO3 retention remains unclear and may be direct (uptake) or indirect (stimulation of microbial activity). We studied the riparian shrub Baccharis salicifolia (seepwillow) in Sycamore Creek (Arizona, USA), to determine (1) if sites colonized by seepwillow were sinks for NO3, and (2) the mechanism by which seepwillow causes NO3 retention. Subsurface water was sampled along flowpaths from an uncolonized gravel bar through seepwillow sites at several depths and on several gravel bars. NO3 concentration was significantly lower in seepwillow sites than in uncolonized sites, at least to 20 cm below the water table. Predictions of three hypotheses were tested to explain NO3 losses: (H1) by plant uptake, (H2) by stimulation of denitrification by seepwillow, and (H3) a prior condition unrelated to seepwillow. Six experiments were used to test these hypotheses, Transplant experiments, plant size relationships, and root distribution experiments all demonstrated the importance of seepwillow (rejection of H3). Other tests involving removal of aboveground biomass, denitrification measures, and mass balance calculations showed a predominance of denitrification over uptake (rejection of H1). We conclude that the main effect of seepwillow is to produce organic matter creating conditions favorable to denitrification and a loss of NO3 from subsurface water. Since denitrification is a permanent loss of N to the atmosphere, and uptake only temporarily retains N, the interaction between plants and microbes has important implications for the maintenance of water quality in streams and downstream reservoirs.",ECOLOGY,82,12,,3363,3376,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000172791800008

The streams have significantly different flow regimes. Consequently, discharge-related factors influence their faunal composition and abundance. The Baharini Springbrook is perennial, slow-flowing with low steady discharge, a higher conductivity and a low conductivity gradient along its course, The Njoro River is intermittent, fast-flowing with a higher and variable discharge, lower conductivity and a steeper conductivity gradient. Due to its permanent and steady surface stream flow, the Baharini Springbrook has a higher number of invertebrate species and higher abundances than (lie Njoro River. However. in spite of (lie intermittent nature of the Njoro River, during periods of relatively steady discharge the composition of its fauna is similar to that of the Baharini Springbrook. Similarity in the substratum characteristics of the two streams and their close proximity is a possible explanation for the close relationship in their faunal composition. At the onset of flow after a drought, rapid colonisation of the lowland intermittent stretch of the Njoro River occurred probably by drift from upstream perennial sections and/or from the hyporheos. Initial small spates it the onset of surface flow seem not to affect the invertebrate abundance, but later bigger spates during and after much heavier rains reduced the fauna] abundance significantly.

P. wrightii trees had highest productivity. and the forests had greatest compositional diversity, where ground water averaged less than 2 m below the tree base during the growing season and less than 0.5 m below the stream thalweg, and where ground water fluctuated annually by less than a meter. Where ground water was at a depth of 3 to 5 m, trees had low growth rates and low, seasonally fluctuating stem water potentials. Ground water tolerance ranges differ between juvenile and adult life stages, and P. wrightii seedlings were largest and most abundant where ground water was less than 0.5 m below the hood plain surface. Productivity and diversity generally were highest in perennial stream reaches: however, values also were high at the one ephemeral-how site (Garden Canyon) that had high and stable ground water tables.

We examined the effects of this erosion in four wadis in the central Negev desert on soil nutrients, plant community structure and plant quality. We predicted that erosion has caused reductions in soil nutrients. Reductions in soil nutrients should result in reductions in plant cover. Furthermore, reduced soil nutrient availability should cause reductions in the nutrient status and quality of the plants growing there. In addition to the loss of biodiversity that may result, this erosion may result in economic hardship for the Bedouin peoples whose herds depend on these resources. In this study, there were significant negative effects of erosion on soil organic carbon, nitrate nitrogen and water-holding capacity, but not on soil phosphorus, conductivity or pH. Furthermore, there was a negative effect of soil erosion on an overall measure of soil quality derived from a principal components analysis in three of the four wadis we studied. Erosion resulted in an increase in plant species richness and significantly altered plant community structure in eroded areas of wadis. Increased plant species richness in eroded sites is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis of plant community structure. Plants growing in eroded areas did not differ in two quality indices (nitrogen content and digestibility), although plants typical of eroded areas had significantly lower levels of common digestion inhibitors (total polyphenols) and toxins (alkaloids) than plants from undisturbed sites. These last-mentioned results are contrary to our prediction and are consistent with the notion that plants growing in disturbed (e.g. eroded) sites maximize growth at the expense of investments in defense.

Biogeochemistry,2001,"Zaady, E; Offer, ZY; Shachak, M","The content and contributions of deposited aeolian organic matter in a dry land ecosystem of the Negev Desert, Israel","The northern Negev desert in Israel has a mosaic of two types of plant community patches. One is dominated by vascular plants (shrub patches) and the other by a nonvascular crust community (crust patches) consisting of cyanobacteria, bacteria, algae, mosses and lichens. The crust patches are sources of soil material and sediment - laden runoff water while the shrub patches are the sinks and function as 'islands of fertility' in the desert environment. Accumulation of resources is often a limiting factor in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of high nutrient organic residues that are readily decomposable, to the aeolian deposition on the crust patches. During the five years of the study, three dominant groups were found in the organic matter: plant material, insect and snail residue (feces). The average accumulation of the aeolian deposition of the organic matter showed significant spatial and temporal differences. Similar quantities were found on the north and the south-facing slopes of the watershed with a minimum in the wadi. A significant difference in average accumulated organic matter for the five years was found. The maximum was for the third year (1995) and the minimum for the fifth year(1997). This may be due to the variations in the annual rainfall amount. The results showed that the origin of most of the organic matter content is from native sources. The highest and most significant amount was registered during the spring season, which is the flowering season in the northern Negev. This may explain the high quantity of plant material obtained and the great amounts of insect and snail (feces) residue that were also found during this season. Since the crust patches serve as a source of water and nutrients in this ecosystem, the organic residues that are of high nutrient quality and readily decomposable, contribute to the productivity of the shrub patches and thus of the overall ecosystem.

Riparian features of the sites, including bankfull width, composition, cover, shade, and relative amount of tree debris, were also measured, and local and basin abiotic variables were determined. Woody vegetation in the Sado basin was species poor and was dominated by the ash Fraxinus angustifolia, the alder Alnus glutinosa, and the willows Salix alba and S. salvifolia. The study sites included a broad range of cover and riparian longitudinal integrity. Macroinvertebrate assemblages revealed low levels of richness (4-29 taxa, average 17.6) and Shannon's diversity (0.65-2.87 bits, average 1.89), and were dominated by species or groups (especially chironomids) that tolerate organic pollution and habitat disturbance. Assemblages were composed of collector-gatherers (5.4-100%, average 58.1), and to a lesser extent collector-filterers (0-81.3%, average 14.1) and shredders (0-25.5%, average 10.6). Partial canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the macroinvertebrate assemblages to the riparian characteristics of a site and to local and basin abiotic variables. Out of 8 riparian variables, overhanging tree shade, total tree cover, and abundance of F angustifolia and A. glutinosa were significant predictors of assemblage variation. Of the 21 abiotic variables considered, only conductivity, distance from source, and the average number of flowless summer months were significant predictors of assemblage variation. Total macroinvertebrate variation was divided into portions that were: 1) explained solely by abiotic variables (similar to14%); 2) explained solely by riparian variables (similar to18%); 3) explained by both riparian and abiotic variables (similar to2%); and 4) unexplained (similar to66%).

The resulting hydrology is complex and the response of solutes in the streams is often unpredictable. This study aimed to identify the most relevant factors controlling the hydrological responses to storms of an intermittent Mediterranean stream and to link those factors with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate during storm events. Measurements of climate, hydrology, DOC and nitrate concentrations during 26 storm events over three hydrological years were analysed. The contribution of the storm events to the total DOC and nitrate annual export was also calculated. Nitrate was mainly mobilised during high flow, while most of the DOC export occurred during baseflow. Solute concentrations peaked after drought periods and the solute export was maximal during the largest rainfalls (i.e.>100 L m(-2)). One single large storm contributed some 22% of the total annual export of DOC, and about 80% of that of nitrate. Discharge was a good predictor of neither DOC nor nitrate responses, so variables other than discharge were considered. Factor Analysis was used to identify the main factors controlling the biogeochemical responses. Antecedent moisture conditions and the magnitude of the storm event were the most relevant factors and accounted for 63% of the total variance. Solute responses during high flow were highly variable. However, solute concentration changes showed a significant and moderate relationship with the factors controlling the hydrological responses (i.e. Delta DOC v. the antecedent moisture conditions and Delta NO3-N v. the magnitude of the storm event).",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,6,6,,1031,1041,,,,27th General Meeting of the European-Geophysical-Society,"APR, 2002",European Geophys Soc,"NICE, FRANCE",1027-5606,,WOS:000181132200009
Assessment,2002,"Blasch, Kyle W.; Ferre, Ty P. A.; Christensen, Allen H.; Hoffmann, John P.",New Field Method to Determine Streamflow Timing Using Electrical Resistance Sensors,"Electrical resistance (ER) sensors were constructed to monitor streambed saturation to infer ephemeral streamflow timing. The sensors were evaluated in an ephemeral stream through comparison with temperature-based methods, a stream gauge, and soil water content sensors. The ER sensors were more accurate at estimating streamflow timing and the resultant data required less interpretation than data from temperature-based methods. Accuracy was equivalent to timing methods using stream gauge and soil water content measurements. The ER sensors are advantageous for use in ephemeral stream channels because they are inexpensive, deployable above or below the sediment surface, insensitive to depth, and do not require connecting wires to an external datalogger or power source. On the basis of these results, we conclude that ER sensors may be used to monitor changes in soil water content within the vadose zone.

The freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense (Decapoda: Palaemonidae), is an abundant species throughout the rivers of western Queensland, and it is thought to have effective dispersal capabilities. Given the very low topographical relief of the western Queensland landscape and the vast nature of episodic flooding, it was predicted that widespread dispersal in this species would occur within, and possibly between the four major catchments of the region: the Darling, Bulloo, Cooper and Diamantina. We analysed eight polymorphic allozyme systems and a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene to determine the extent of recent and historical patterns of dispersal at nested spatial scales, within and between catchments.2. Large and significant levels of allozyme and mtDNA differentiation were revealed among all catchments, indicating that dispersal of M. australiense does not occur across catchment boundaries, although this species is reportedly capable of overland movement. In contrast, no significant patterns of genetic differentiation were resolved between major subcatchments of the Darling and Cooper, or between sites within these subcatchments, indicating that populations of M. australiense are panmictic within catchments.3. The MtDNA data resolved two divergent and reciprocally monophyletic clades, with the first representing the Darling catchment, and the second corresponding to the Bulloo, Cooper and Diamantina catchments. We postulate that extreme variation in historical climatic patterns and palaeohydrologic conditions played an important role in shaping the population structure of M. australiense throughout western Queensland during the Quaternary.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,47,11,,2098,2112,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00953.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000178848300006

The roads and the bridges of comunication between the town and the rest of the province were destroyed along with 250 hectares of cultivated land. The damages were estimated at 300 millions of pesetas.A heavy rainstorm (600 mm) produced the rapid development of a high density flow in the dry stream, with an elevated volume of sediments (113 of the discharge), that was the responsible factor of the high discharge reachedduring the flood (2580 m(3)/s).The object of this study is not only the identification of the episode and the analysis of the disaster's social impact, but also to analyse the different techniques to study the flooding in this type of fluvial system. The historic reconstruction of the event includes an analysis of the social impact and restoration works of the affected area. In addition the hydrologic analyses of the flooding that was based on the study of the greatest floods in small basins has been carried out. Finally, a morphodynamic and sedimentologic reconstruction was undertaken. The sedimentological study of deposits corresponding to the flash flood shows that the dynamic nature of these alluvial channels has important implications for floodplain management policy.

Environmental water provisions are under consideration for the Ord River in far northern Western Australia. This river has been regulated for irrigation and there are plans for substantial expansion. Like other semi-arid and tropical rivers, however, the hydrology of the Ord River is highly variable and unpredictable, and therefore, proportionate water release strategies for the environment that are based on average monthly flows are unsuitable. Regulation continues to produce pronounced ecological changes throughout the river system as the impacts of flow regime are negated. There is a dichotomy in optimal flow regimes for the contrasting management aspirations of ecological restoration based on low seasonal flows, and the dilution flows required for the drainage of agricultural effluent. Whilst current agricultural land and water management practices continue, the two cannot coincide, and consequently, a decision should be made regarding which environmental water allocation holds the primary value. Such a decision would guide the appropriate dry season flow regime on the lower Ord River.

Several relevant aspects contribute to make this purpose scientifically challenging. Two thirds of the basin are located in Spanish territory, a large part of the river system is intermittent, the historical reference data on river plants in the basin are non-existent and the distribution patterns of Iberian river plants are scarcely known. A survey of 40 sites was conducted in late spring 1999, covering all the basin. Vegetation data were treated by hierarchical classification and by canonical correspondence analysis, using both environmental (19) and anthropogenic (9) variables. Three plant ecotypes were identified, having different geological and geographical backgrounds. For the selection of reference sites of each ecotype, the environmental variables significantly explaining within-ecotype species distribution were determined by a forward selection procedure and latterly used as co-variables. A partial canonical correspondence analysis was then performed for each ecotype, using a unique variable for the anthropogenic influence, henceforth, leading to a sequence of less human disturbed sites being opposed to the more disturbed ones along the first canonical axis. A cluster analysis for the group of sites of each ecotype contributed to the final distinction of the reference sites, still presenting some intrinsic natural floral variability. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity within the group of sites from each ecotype ranged between a natural similarity variation and a maximum dissimilarity (a community within the same ecotype but with a plant composition completely different from the floral reference). This range was partitioned into four classes of floristic quality corresponding to an increasing deviation from the pro-natural floristic state. The use of river plants as indicators of river integrity and the method used are discussed, considering the particular features of the river system studied and its plant assemblages.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,155,1,,121,145,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000177786900007
"Fish, Assessment",2002,"Filipe, AF; Cowx, IG; Collares-Pereira, MJ",Spatial modelling of freshwater fish in semi-arid river systems: A tool for conservation,"This paper examines the feasibility of using multivariate statistics to model fish species distribution and habitat requirements for intermittent streams in semi-arid regions, many of which are coming under increasing pressure from water resource development schemes. The assessment was based on the geographical distribution of six endemic fish species in the Guadiana river, a semi-arid river system in southern Iberia. Their presence was related to 20 environmental variables linked to climate, geomorphology, riparian vegetation and location in the drainage basin. These variables were collected in the field or from topographical maps, to evaluate habitat suitability and to predict the presence of the species according to season. Multivariate logistic regression in a geographic information system (GIS) environment was performed to identify regions with high probability of occurrence for each species. The variables that best explained the occurrence of the species were the sample location in the drainage basin, the geomorphology and the riparian vegetation. The models presented have a high predictive power and can be used in monitoring and predicting temporal changes caused by human activities. This modelling approach can be used to predict the areas that need to be conserved to protect or rehabilitate the endangered species. Armed with this information, managers can formulate conservation measures to prevent further degradation of the stocks and possibly enhance the populations.

In large lowland rivers like the Darling, lateral (river-floodplain) interactions can greatly influence both physical and biological components of the system. The floodplain and riparian zone of the Darling River is dominated by River Red Gum (RRG), Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The large amount of organic matter they produce accumulates on the floodplain and on benches within the channel, and is subject to alternate periods of flooding and drying as a result of highly variable flows. This paper examines the effect of alternate periods of flooding and drying on the processing of E. camaldulensis organic matter. Results of the 6-month in situ field study, together with results from laboratory experiments comparing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release from various RRG litter types, suggest that RRG leaves provide the most bio-available source of carbon to the system, while bark may be more important as a habitat for invertebrates and other fauna. Laboratory experiments exploring the effect of drying and re-flooding on litter breakdown and release of DOC suggested that the majority of DOC was released from RRG leaves in the first 24 h of inundation. Also, upon drying and re-flooding of the leaves, a smaller but significant release of DOC occurred. However, an alternative wet/dry cycle did not affect weight loss of the leaf litter. Results of the field and lab experiments suggest that RRG leaves represent an important source of carbon to the Darling River, with inputs being influenced by the highly variable flow regime.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,481,41699,,113,124,,10.1023/A:1021269205983,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000179387400009

Benthic taxa richness and diversity at the perennial headwater site were significantly greater than richness and diversity at intermittent sites, whereas the downstream perennial site did not differ significantly from two of the intermittent sites. The larger magnitude of floods at the downstream perennial site resulted in greater losses in richness than at the upstream intermittent and perennial sites. Both classification and ordination revealed that benthic assemblage composition was more strongly correlated with time since last disturbance and season than with static hydrologic descriptors, microhabitat measures, or assemblage characteristics (richness or density). Richness of aerial colonization and drift samples collected at intermittent sites was greatest at the site with the nearest upstream perennial surface water.

Biogeochemistry,2002,"Kozlowski, TT",Physiological-ecological impacts of flooding on riparian forest ecosystems,"Riparian forest ecosystems are important for their high productivity of biomass, their biodiversity, and ecological services including control of floods and erosion, removal of nutrients from agricultural runoff, alleviation of pollution effects, and as habitats for birds and mammals. Intermittent cycles of flooding by meandering streams followed by soil drainage are essential for regeneration, optimal growth, preservation of biodiversity, and sustainability of these valuable ecosystems. The straightening of river channels and disruption of intermittent river flow by dams lead to decreases in downstream forest productivity and ecological services, reflecting arrested forest regeneration, suppression of tree growth, and early tree mortality. These responses result from inadequate seed supplies and poor seedbeds, as well as deficiencies of ground water and mineral nutrients. Water deficits in downstream forest trees induce dysfunctions in photosynthesis and mineral nutrition, which lead to growth inhibition and plant mortality. Very few bottomland forest species can withstand extended soil inundation. Hence, prolonged upstream flooding by interruption of river flow is followed by massive losses of biomass as a result of poor seed germination, arrested plant growth, and accelerated mortality of trees. The adverse impacts of flooding on upstream forests are associated with physiological dysfunctions induced by soil anaerobiosis. These include changes in respiration, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, mineral nutrition, and hormone relations, together with increased exposure to a variety of phytotoxic compounds. There is urgent need for developing more integrated and holistic flood-management policies that will recognize the need for protecting and restoring valuable riparian forests while also meeting other flood-control objectives.",WETLANDS,22,3,,550,561,,10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022[0550:PEIOFO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0277-5212,,WOS:000178600900011

Although the movement of DU into major aquatic systems has been shown to be minimal, there are many small-order ephemeral streams and areas of standing water in canyons throughout LANL that may be affected by inputs of DU via runoff, erosion, and leaching. Ninety-six-hour acute and 7-d chronic toxicity assays were conducted to measure the toxicity of DU on survival and reproduction of Ceriodaphnia dabia. A 14-d water-only assay was conducted to measure survival and growth of Hyalella azteca. The estimated median lethal concentration (LC50) to produce 50% mortality of the test population for the 96-h Ceriodaphnia dubia assay was 10.50 mg/L. Reproductive effects occurred at a lowest-observable-effect concentration greater than or equal to3.91 mg/L with a no-observable-effect concentration of 1.97 mg/L. The estimated 14-d LC50 for the Hyalella azteca assay was 1.52 mg/L. No significant relationship was detected between growth and DU concentrations.

Invertebrate,2002,"Lytle, DA",Flash floods and aquatic insect life-history evolution: Evaluation of multiple models,"In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred before the long-term (similar to100 yr) mean arrival date of the first seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season, respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics. The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with long-term flood dynamics.",ECOLOGY,83,2,,370,385,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000173538800008
Fish,2002,"Magalhaes, MF; Batalha, DC; Collares-Pereira, MJ",Gradients in stream fish assemblages across a Mediterranean landscape: contributions of environmental factors and spatial structure,"1. Despite wide recognition that fish assemblages are influenced by factors operating over a range of spatial scales, little effort has been devoted to quantifying large-scale variation and the multiscale dependencies of assemblage patterns and processes. This is particularly true for Mediterranean streams, where seasonally predictable drying-up may lead to a strong association between assemblage attributes and large-scale factors affecting the distribution of population sources and extinction likelihood.2. The contribution of large-scale factors to stream fish assemblage variation was quantified across a Mediterranean landscape, in south-west Portugal. Fish abundance and species composition were estimated at 166 sites across third- to sixth-order streams, in March-July 1998. Variance partitioning by redundancy analyses was used to analyse assemblage variation against three sets of predictor variables: environmental (catchment position, and geomorphic and hydrological factors), large-scale spatial trends and neighbourhood effects.3. Environmental variables and spatial trends accounted for 34.6% of the assemblage variation across the entire region, and for 36.6 and 57.8% within the two largest catchments (Mira and Seixe). Neighbourhood effects were analysed at the catchment scale, increasing the explained variation to 56.1% (Mira) and 70.7% (Seixe).4. A prevailing environmental gradient was reflected in an increase in the abundance of all species and size-classes in relation to catchment position, with more fish present in larger streams and in downstream reaches. Variables describing geomorphic and hydrological settings were less important in explaining assemblage variation.5. Spatial trends always accounted for the smallest fraction of assemblage variation, and they were probably associated with historical barriers to fish dispersal. The strong neighbourhood effects may be related to spatially autocorrelated habitat conditions, but they are also a likely consequence of fish emigration/extinction and colonisation processes.6. These results emphasise that a substantial proportion of fish assemblage variation in Mediterranean streams may be explained by large-scale factors, irrespective of microhabitats and local biotic interactions. It is suggested that this pattern results to a large extent from the seasonal drying-up, with the summer shortage of surface water limiting fish occurrence in headwaters, and consequently the key core areas for fish concentrating in larger streams and tributaries adjacent to large streams because of neighbourhood effects.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,47,5,,1015,1031,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00830.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000175251100009
Fish,2002,"Magalhaes, MF; Beja, P; Canas, C; Collares-Pereira, MJ",Functional heterogeneity of dry-season fish refugia across a Mediterranean catchment: the role of habitat and predation,"1. Fish in Mediterranean streams survive through the summer in residual surface waters, encompassing a broad range of abiotic and biotic conditions. Yet, the extent to which fish assemblages may be shaped by functional heterogeneity in dry-season refugia is largely unknown. This study addresses this issue, by examining fish assemblage and population attributes, and predation patterns in residual summer habitats (12 pools and six runs) across a Mediterranean catchment in south-west Portugal.2. Species richness was fairly constant among runs but increased with pool size, with the addition of exotics and rare natives to large pools resulting in nested subsets. The four most common species (chub, nase, loach and eel) were considered generalists in terms of their use of dry-season refugia. Conversely, rare species presented more specialised habitats, with barbel and exotics favouring pools and stickleback favouring runs.3. Age and size of the two most common species varied among dry-season habitats. Age 0 chub were restricted to runs, where spawning stages (age 2 and older fish) were also more represented. Age 0 nase also concentrated in runs, but the individuals collected in pools exhibited greater growth. Conversely, age 2 and older nase were proportionally more abundant in pools, but with greater growth and better condition in runs.4. The otter was the main fish predator, consuming fish of all species and size classes, irrespective of habitat. Otter activity concentrated in pools, where predation risk for cyprinids seemed to be much higher than in runs.5.

Results from an interbiome comparison study,"Nutrient uptake length is an important parameter for quantifying nutrient cycling in streams. Although nutrient tracer additions are the preferred method for measuring uptake length under ambient nutrient concentrations, short-term nutrient addition experiments have more frequently been used to estimate uptake length in streams. Theoretical analysis of the relationship between uptake length determined by nutrient addition experiments (S-w') and uptake length determined by tracer additions (S-w) predicted that S-w' should be consistently longer than S-w, and that the overestimate of uptake length by S-w' should be related to the level of nutrient addition above ambient concentrations and the degree of nutrient limitation. To test these predictions, we used data from an interbiome study of NH4+ uptake length in which (NH4+)-N-15 tracer and short-term NH4+ addition experiments were performed in 10 streams using a uniform experimental approach. The experimental results largely confirmed the theoretical predictions: S-W' was consistently longer than S,a, and S,,':S,, ratios were directly related to the level of NH4+ addition and to indicators of N limitation. The experimentally derived S-w':S-w ratios were used with the theoretical results to infer the N limitation status of each stream. Together, the theoretical and experimental results showed that tracer experiments should be used whenever possible to determine nutrient uptake length in streams. Nutrient addition experiments may be useful for comparing uptake lengths between different streams or different times in the same stream, however, provided that nutrient additions are kept as low as possible and of similar magnitude.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,21,4,,544,560,,10.2307/1468429,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000179505500003

The maximum ages observed were 3+ years in males and 4+ years in females. Both sexes matured at the beginning of their second year of life. There was a significant difference from 1 : 1 in the overall sex ratio of 412 males to 674 females. Spawning began in late March and ended in July.

The number of eggs decreased from the first batch to the second, but there was no significant difference in the mean egg diameter between batches.

Fish,2002,"Paugy, D",Reproductive strategies of fishes in a tropical temporary stream of the Upper Senegal basin: Baoule River in Mali,"In the tropics, there is very little information on fish reproduction in intermittent streams and most of the studies are from the neotropic regions. In temporary rivers, environmental conditions are sharply contrasted and the variation amplitude of hydrological and physicochemical characteristics is high. In the Baoule River (Mali), during the peak of the dry season, the remaining pools comprise only 10% of the total length of the river. During the wet season, there is a short (three months) but intense period of flooding. In this study, the reproductive strategies of 18 species of fishes were investigated in the upper reach of the Baoule drainage. They belong to eight families, show variation in feeding guilds, and vary in size and habitat preferences. Fishes were collected from February 1985 to November 1988 using gillnets. Two main types of spawning strategies may be distinguished among these species. The first, the 'total spawners', have generally a short annual spawning period just before the flood. The second, the 'small-brood spawners', produce small batches of eggs at frequent intervals for most of the year. Most of the species inhabiting the Baoule River exhibit a breeding strategy in relation to the flood seasonality. This type of strategy, common in harsh but predictable environments, favours a synchronous reproduction in phase with the optimal environmental conditions and the production of large number of juveniles that require no parental care. Concerning the Baoule River, 12 variables related to life-history theory were measured for 18 species. Clustering of these species based on Euclidean distances resulted in two groups. The first corresponds to developed parental care, large oocytes and low fecundity (about a hundred eggs). Two species, Chrysichthys auratus and Sarotherodon galilaeus, belong to this 'equilibrium strategy'. Others species have a 'seasonal strategy', which is adapted to the harsh local conditions. In the Nilo-Sudanian area, most fishes appeared to be associated with a seasonal life history strategy that exploits an annual expansion of aquatic production. In the Baoule River, the 'seasonal strategy' is characterised by high fecundity, absence of parental care, limited breeding season and for some species large adult size and upstream spawning migrations to floodplains.

Assessment,2002,"Porto, RL; Porto, MFA",Planning as a tool to deal with extreme events - The new Brazilian Water Resources Management System,"This paper describes the recent changes in the Water Resources Management System of Brazil and its proposed approach on how to be more effective when dealing with extreme events. The geographic extent of the country, its regional differences, and the difficult economic conditions lead to a comprehensive reform in the water resources sector in order to increase efficiency of the water uses, to reduce costs, and to promote development. The major change occurred in 1997, with the promulgation of the National Water Resources Management Act, which established the National Water Resources Policy and the National Water Resources Management System. A primary strength of the new system is its decentralization. Different geographical regions of the country must cope with different extreme events. The developed South suffers with frequent flood events due to large urbanized areas and impervious floodplain areas and with water scarcity due to excessive use. The rural Northeast is frequently devastated by severe drought periods with consequences such as migration and poverty. In both cases, the decentralized decision process is a powerful tool to better manage such problematic areas. In fact, to help controlling extreme events is one of the major objectives of the new system, as stated in the law. In intermittent rivers of the Brazilian Northeast, participation of users associations can help finding the best water allocation scheme. When it comes to flood control, community participation in the selection of solutions is essential. Flood protection is a community, rather than individual benefit. Decision on the land use will only be accomplished with the participation of different government levels together with the community.",WATER INTERNATIONAL,27,1,,14,19,,,,,,,,0250-8060,,WOS:000175455700003

Total density and biomass of aquatic insects were higher in temporary streams than in perennial streams. Taxonomic richness was consistently higher in perennial streams. The number of Chironomidae exceeded those of all other taxa, during the spring, but the chironomids were largely replaced by Mycetophilidae as the most abundant taxon during the summer, especially in temporary streams. Trichoptera, and Ephemeroptera emerged in higher numbers from perennial than from temporary streams. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the absence of vertebrate predators (fish and giant salamanders) allows the populations of arthropods in temporary streams to flourish, serving as: (1) a potential source of colonization and (2) an important role in the terrestrial food web as an abundant food source for terrestrial insectivores.",JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,17,3,,391,407,,10.1080/02705060.2002.9663913,,,,,,0270-5060,,WOS:000178017600007

The abundance of most functional groups of waterbirds changed in response to broad scale changes in wetland distribution, while local abundance remained highly variable. Patterns of abundance varied among functional groups of waterbirds, with some immediately responding to changes in wetland distribution and area flooded, and others apparently responding to sequences of wetting and drying. In Australia, the main conservation issue for waterbirds is water and its use across the landscape and not the spatial arrangement of any fixed array of reserves established to protect them.

Biogeochemistry,2002,"Schade, JD; Marti, E; Welter, JR; Fisher, SG; Grimm, NB",Sources of nitrogen to the riparian zone of a desert stream: Implications for riparian vegetation and nitrogen retention,"Riparian zones effectively remove nitrogen (N) from water flowing through riparian soils, particularly in agricultural watersheds. The mechanism of N removal is still unclear, especially the role of vegetation. Uptake and denitrification are the two most commonly studied mechanisms. Retention of groundwater N by plant uptake is often inferred from measurements of N in net incremental biomass. However, this assumes other sources of N are not contributing to the N demand of plants. The purpose of this work was to investigate the relative importance of three sources of available N to riparian trees in a desert stream-input in stream water during floods, input during baseflow, and mineralization of N from soil organic matter. Two approaches were used; a mass balance approach in which the mass of available N from each source was estimated, and a correlational approach in which indexes of each source were compared to leaf N for individual willow trees. Total N from all sources was 396 kg ha(-1) y(-1), with 172 kg ha(-1) y(-1) from mineralization, 214 kg ha(-1) y(-1) from the stream during baseflow, and 9.6 kg ha(-1) y(-1) from floods. Leaf N was significantly related to N mineralization rates and flood inputs; it was not related to baseflow inputs. We conclude that mineralization is a major source of available N for willow trees, subsidized by input of N from floods. Baseflow inputs are most likely removed by rapid denitrification at the stream-riparian edge, while higher rates of flood supply exceed the capacity of this ""filter.""",ECOSYSTEMS,5,1,,68,79,,10.1007/s10021-001-0056-6,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000175429300006

Efforts to manage and conserve the surface waters of these rivers are hampered by limited scientific data on the ecology of their flora and fauna and on their responses to the high natural variability of flow regime that typifies dryland rivers. Irregular floods connect channel and floodplain wetlands to differing degrees and for varying periods of time but the ecological significance of this connectivity is poorly understood. On Cooper Creek, a large dryland river in central Australia. we explored the degree to which assemblage composition varied with connectivity and hydrological regime. Shortly after protracted regional flooding, we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages from the principal microhabitats in 12 channel and floodplain wetlands. Ephemeral and temporary lakes tended to have fewer taxa than semi-permanent channel or terminal lake habitats. Although hydrological connection had only recently been lost for some wetlands, there was already evidence of divergence in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Disruption of the natural variability in connectivity and hydrological regime by excessive water abstraction or river-flow regulation threatens the ecological integrity and aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of dryland rivers. Preservation of the irregular flow regime and sporadic connectivity underpins conservation of the mosaic of floodplain wetlands that play such a crucial role in the ecosystem functioning of rivers such as Cooper Creek.

"Invertebrate, Biogeochemistry",2002,"Stagliano, DM; Whiles, MR",Macroinvertebrate production and trophic structure in a tallgrass prairie headwater stream,"Research on North American prairie stream communities has lagged behind other regions. We examined the ecosystem significance of the macroinvertebrate community of riffle/run habitats in Kings Creek, a 2(nd)-order tallgrass prairie stream at Konza Prairie Biological Station (Kansas, USA), by estimating secondary production, benthic organic matter standing stocks, and resource consumption and egestion by functional groups. Annual mean standing stock macroinvertebrate biomass was 2.3 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM)/m(2), annual production was 19.7 a AFDM m(-2) y(-1), and the annual community production/biomass (P/B) ratio was 8.6. Macroinvertebrate production was higher than published estimates for forested streams of similar size, but much lower than that of a Sonoran desert stream. Distribution of production among functional groups was 30% for collector-gatherers, 9% for collector-filterers, 20% for scrapers, 23% for shredders, and 18% for predators, resembling estimates from some forested streams with the exception of higher scraper production. Although detritivorous groups were productive in this prairie stream, they appeared food limited. Consumption estimates indicated shredders and collector-gatherers annually ingested similar to80% and similar to240% of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) standing stocks, respectively. Thus, re-ingestion and/or diet shifts may be common, particularly among collector-gatherers, and the FPOM pool must turn over rapidly. Invertebrate predators also consumed a sizeable portion (similar to52%) of prey, whereas scrapers (similar to21%) and filterers (<1%) consumed relatively small portions of their respective resources, suggesting top-down influences on these groups. This study indicates that, during a period of relatively stable flow in this prairie stream, macroinvertebrate production and functional structure were roughly intermediate between North American forested and desert systems.

An ecosystem approach for determining environmental water allocations in dryland regions is presented in this paper. This four-step process involves (1) a hierarchical characterisation of the river system, to assess what mesohabitats are present and where they are located; (2) the determination of flows that would inundate these habitats and perform other key ecological processes; (3) hydrological analyses in which the key hydrological signatures of the river are identified and the impact of water resource development on these is determined and (4) the derivation of a water management decision tree that enables managers to allocate water to consumptive users during individual flood pulses (events). It is recommended that the flood pulse should be the focus for environmental flow management in dryland regions. If rivers are indeed nested hierarchies, then a change in hydrological behaviour at the scale of a flood pulse will, with time, extend throughout the hydrological hierarchy. Current environmental flow management strategies in dryland river systems are essentially focused at the flow regime and history scale; this is inappropriate given the inherent flow variability of these systems. The ecosystem approach is outlined for the Condamine-Balonne River, a large dryland system in Australia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fish,2003,"Bernardo, JM; Ilheu, M; Matono, P; Costa, AM",Interannual variation of fish assemblage structure in a Mediterranean River: Implications of streamflow on the dominance of native or exotic species,"Streams in mediterranean-type climate regions are shaped by predictable seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle, but also present a strong interannual flow variation.The Guadiana River is one of the most important rivers in the Iberian Peninsula. The fish fauna presents 11 native freshwater species, including eight with high conservation status. Several exotic species are present, the most important being the American centrarchids pumpkinseed fish and largemouth bass. As a typical mediterranean-type river, the Guadiana has an irregular hydrological regime with severe drought periods and floods; the interannual variation of discharge presents a ratio of c. 100 to 1.From 1980 to 1995 several dry years were observed, culminating in the drought of 1991/92-1994/95. Analysing the variation of the fish assemblage structure during this period, exotic species (mostly pumpkinseed) progressively increased, strongly dominating in 1995. Indigenous populations dramatically decreased and a previously common endemic cyprinid (Anaecypris hispanica Steindachner) became endangered and one of the most threatened fishes of Europe. However, the following years presented above-average flows with several flood events and an inverse process occurred, with native species increasing their contribution in a short period.The importance of floods as a disturbance factor in the control of lentic or slow flowing water exotics is discussed. Native species apparently possess adaptive responses to high flows which exotics lack. This hypothesis is consistent with probability-of-use curves and preflood-postflood surveys. Results emphasize the importance of floods in the environmental flows of mediterranean-type rivers. In the absence of flooding disturbance, exotic fish populations predictably grow, increasing the pressure on native species; abiotic disturbance may supersede deterministic outcomes of predation or competition and influence community structure by reducing populations of the exotic species.

Fish,2003,"Bond, NR; Lake, PS",Characterizing fish-habitat associations in streams as the first step in ecological restoration,"Habitat availability is often regarded as the primary factor that limits population and community recovery in degraded ecosystems, and physical habitat is thus often targeted in restoration. The identification of which habitat(s) to attempt to restore is a critical step in the restoration process, but one for which there is often a paucity of useful information. Here we examine the distribution of fish in three lowland streams in Victoria, Australia, that have been degraded by severe sedimentation. We aim to identify habitats that are associated with high abundances of native fish, and that thus might be appropriate to target in habitat restoration. Associations between native fish abundances and physical habitat characteristics were examined at three spatial scales (among streams, among sites and within sites) to determine the types of habitat to which fish respond, and the scales over which these responses occur. Of the four species of native fish found in the streams, three (Galaxias olidus Gunther, Gadopsis marmoratus (Richardson) and Nanoperca australis Gunther) showed significant habitat associations at small spatial scales (i.e. within sites). In particular, these species were generally found in deeper water, and in close proximity to cover (typically either coarse or fine woody debris or vegetation). Differences in habitat availability among sites and streams were less influential, except in the case of G. marmoratus, which was completely absent from both the ephemeral streams. Although our results suggest that these species collectively respond to habitat at several spatial scales, fish distributions were allied to the presence of habitat structure at the scale of metres, the smallest spatial scale examined. We hypothesize that fish abundances are currently limited by the low availability of habitat at these small spatial scales. It may therefore be possible to increase fish abundances in these creeks by augmenting the amount of available habitat via stream restoration.",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,28,6,,611,621,,10.1046/j.1442-9993.2003.t01-1-01317.x,,,,,,1442-9985,,WOS:000186753900003

Upstream farmers impound surface water during brief rainfall periods while remaining stakeholders' abstract water from the alluvial aquifer.

The Department of Water Affairs, Nam-Water and the Gobabeb Training and Research Centre are contributing information to enhance understanding of the river's functions and services provided. All stakeholders are sharing information concerning their needs, expectations and contributions toward integrated management of the Kuiseb. After negotiation for one-and-a-half years, a formal committee is established and mechanisms for its functioning and sustainability are being identified.

Invertebrate,2003,"Boulton, AJ",Parallels and contrasts in the effects of drought on stream macroinvertebrate assemblages,"1. It is axiomatic that unusually long dry periods (droughts) adversely affect aquatic biota. Recovery after drought is rapid by macroinvertebrates that possess strategies to survive drying or are highly mobile but other taxa take longer to recolonise depending on the timing, intensity, and duration of the dry phase.2. Although drought acts as a sustained 'ramp' disturbance, impacts may be disproportionately severe when certain critical thresholds are exceeded. For example, ecological changes may be gradual while a riffle dries but cessation of flow causes abrupt loss of a specific habitat, alteration of physicochemical conditions in pools downstream, and fragmentation of the river ecosystem. Many ecological responses to drought within these habitats apparently depend on the timing and rapidity of hydrological transitions across these thresholds, exhibiting a 'stepped' response alternating between gradual change while a threshold is approached followed by a swift transition when a habitat disappears or is fragmented.3. In two Australian intermittent streams, drought conditions eliminated or decimated several groups of macroinvertebrates, including atyid shrimps, stoneflies and free-living caddisflies. These taxa persisted during the early stages of the drought but did not recruit successfully the following year, despite a return to higher-than-baseflow conditions. This 'lag effect' in response to drought emphasises the value of long-term survey data. Although changes in faunal composition were inconsistent among sites, marked shifts in taxa richness, abundance and trophic organisation after the riffle habitat dried provide evidence for a stepped response.4. Responses by macroinvertebrate assemblages to droughts of differing severity in English chalk streams were variable. The prolonged 1988-92 drought had a greater impact than shorter droughts in the early 1970s but recovery over the next 3 years was swift. Effects of the 1995 summer drought were buffered by sustained groundwater discharge from the previous winter. These droughts tended to reduce available riverine habitats, especially via siltation, but few taxa were eliminated because they could recolonise from perennial sections of the chalk streams.5. In the contrasting environments of the intermittent streams studied in England and Australia, there are parallels in the rapid rates of recolonisation. However, recruitment by taxa that lack desiccation-resistant stages or have limited mobility is delayed. Currently, long-term data on these systems may be insufficient to indicate persistent effects of droughts or predict the impacts of excessive surface or groundwater abstraction or the increased frequency and duration of droughts expected with global climate change.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,7,,1173,1185,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01084.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000183640900004

However, impacts of these chemicals on natural stream ecosystems are poorly known. Unintentional aerial application of fire-fighting chemicals (Phos-Chek WD-881 and ForExspan S) onto two small streams during a natural wildfire on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, provided an opportunity to study the short-term effects on water chemistry and aquatic invertebrates. Within 2 weeks of application, samples of water and macroinvertebrates were collected from sites upstream of the application point, within the zone of application, and downstream where burning had been controlled on two streams. Three sites on a reference stream in the same sub-catchment that had been burned by the same fire but without application of fire-suppressants were also sampled. All sites were resampled three months later (within two weeks of the first flushing rains). There were no marked differences in water quality among the sites on the reference stream but in one of the impacted streams where flow had ceased before the fire, dissolved and total phosphorus concentrations were elevated at the site where the fire-suppressants were applied. Phosphorus concentrations were reduced 2-3-fold at this site after brief flushing by rain. Conversely, dissolved and total N and P concentrations at the other impacted stream that flowed permanently did not differ among the sites and there was no evidence for persistent changes to water quality from the applied fire-suppressant foams. Taxon richness was higher at the application and downstream sites than at upstream sites in the two impacted streams. There were also no discernible effects of the fire-suppressants on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition or taxon richness within the two streams two weeks after the chemical application or soon after flushing rains. Assemblage composition in the temporary stream was significantly different from that in the reference and the other impacted stream but also appeared unaffected by the fire-suppressants. The lack of impact on resident stream macroinvertebrates may result partly from their inherent high tolerance to the harsh physical and chemical conditions of these streams, many of which typically cease flow in summer.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,498,41699,,177,189,,10.1023/A:1026213301871,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000186041600010
"Fish, Biogeochemistry, ",2003,"Bunn, SE; Davies, PM; Winning, M",Sources of organic carbon supporting the food web of an arid zone floodplain river,"1. Many Australian inland rivers are characterised by vast floodplains with a network of anastomosing channels that interconnect only during unpredictable flooding. For much of the time, however, rivers are reduced to a string of disconnected and highly turbid waterholes. Given these features, we predicted that aquatic primary production would be light-limited and the riverine food web would be dependent on terrestrial carbon from floodplain exchanges and direct riparian inputs.2. To test these predictions, we measured rates of benthic primary production and respiration and sampled primary sources of organic carbon and consumers for stable isotope analysis in several river waterholes at four locations in the Cooper Creek system in central Australia.3. A conspicuous band of filamentous algae was observed along the shallow littoral zone of the larger waterholes. Despite the high turbidity, benthic gross primary production in this narrow zone was very high (1.7-3.6 g C m(-2) day(-1) ); about two orders of magnitude greater than that measured in the main channel.4. Stable carbon isotope analysis confirmed that the band of algae was the major source of energy for aquatic consumers, ultimately supporting large populations of crustaceans and fish. Variation in the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of consumers suggested that zooplankton was the other likely major source.5. Existing ecosystem models of large rivers often emphasise the importance of longitudinal or lateral inputs of terrestrial organic matter as a source of organic carbon for aquatic consumers. Our data suggest that, despite the presence of large amounts of terrestrial carbon, there was no evidence of it being a significant contributor to the aquatic food web in this floodplain river system.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,4,,619,635,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01031.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000181632400005

The riparian groundwater system is characterized by drastic hydrological changes and by mixing of stream water with hillslope groundwater. The hillslope groundwater flowed through a medium with low hydraulic conductivity (9.6 10(-3) < k(s) < 0.1 m d(-1)) and low specific discharges (1.7 10(-3) < q(hll) < 15 10(-3) m d(-1)). In contrast, stream water infiltrated through the near stream porous medium with relatively high hydraulic conductivity (4.8 < k(s) < 19 m d(-1)) and variable specific discharges (i.e., 0.03 < q(st) < 1.5 m d(-1)). An intense and short stream discharge period occurred in autumn, when stream water infiltrated a maximum of 10 m into the riparian zone. Nitrate concentration and nitrate removal spatial rates (eta(NO3)) showed wide spatial heterogeneity. Higher nitrate concentrations (3.4 NO3-N mg L-1) and effective nitrate removal (eta(NO3) = 0.098 +/- 0.04 m(-1)) were found in the deep groundwater of hillslope zone associated to low water fluxes. In contrast, in the stream edge zone ( with higher water fluxes), nitrate release predominated over depletion (eta(NO3) = -0.13 +/- 0.04 m(-1)) during the stream discharge period. This opposite pattern of nitrate removal observed in the study area suggests that the depletion of diffuse nitrate inputs in riparian zones bounded by intermittent streams requires careful consideration.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,39,4,,,,1110,10.1029/2001WR001260,,,,,,0043-1397,,WOS:000182867700001
Biogeochemistry,2003,"Claret, C; Boulton, AJ",Diel variation in surface and subsurface microbial activity along a gradient of drying in an Australian sand-bed stream,"1. Microbes play key roles in nutrient transformation and organic matter mineralisation in the hyporheic zone but their short-term responses to diel variations in discharge and temperature are unknown. Rates of microbial esterase activity were hypothesised to vary vertically and along a gradient of moisture in a drying sand-bed stream where discharge fluctuated daily in response to evapotranspiration.2. At 'fully saturated', 'moist' and 'dry' locations in three sites along a drying Australian sand-bed stream, microbial activity at three depths ( surface, 10 and 30 cm) was assessed using fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Samples were collected in mid-summer in the late afternoon and again at dawn to assess diel variation in hydrolytic activity at each site and depth. Data loggers tracked diel variations in temperature at each depth.3. Hydrolytic activity was up to 10-fold greater in the surface sediments in late afternoon than at dawn in all habitats, and was correlated with surface sediment temperature. Diel differences in activity were not detected at 10 cm, although daily thermal cycles were evident at this depth. Unexpectedly, activity was marginally higher at dawn at 30 cm in all habitats, perhaps reflecting lags in temperature at that depth.4. Overall, microbial activity declined with depth, strongly correlated with vertical trends in total organic matter and concentrations of dissolved phosphorus. Particulate organic matter, probably buried during a flood 35 days earlier, appeared largely responsible for these vertical trends. On the other hand, there was little evidence for hydrological exchange between much of the hyporheic zone and the surface stream, implying that processes in the subsurface zone of this stream are effectively isolated during baseflow in mid-summer.5. Diel cycles of wetting and drying in the moist habitats did not enhance esterase activity relative to the dry or fully saturated habitats. Sediment moisture was not correlated with microbial activity, and mats of senescent algae appeared to inhibit water loss from surface sediments in the moist habitat. In this sand-bed stream, local diel fluctuations in water level appear to have less influence on microbial activity and mineralisation of organic matter in the sediments than occasional floods that bury leaf litter and renew many hyporheic zone functions. Subreach-scale processes seem to be the major driving force of microbial processes and nutrient cycling in this sand-bed river.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,10,,1739,1755,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01120.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000185347900003

What was previously an ephemeral river punctuated by large flood events now contains permanent, regulated flows all year round, and fundamental changes in the downstream channel morphology are now evident. Further changes to the regulated flow regime are planned as part of the eventual expansion of the irrigation area. It is necessary to understand and document the channel responses that have occurred in the Lower Ord so far as a result of flow regulation. This paper presents a GIS based investigation into morphological change in the Lower Ord River.

Severe or extreme droughts occurred about 10% of the time over a 105-year record from central New Mexico, U.S.A., based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index.2. Drought lowers water tables, creating extensive areas of groundwater recharge and fragmenting reaches of streams and rivers. Deeper groundwater inputs predominate as sources of surface flows during drought. Nutrient inputs to streams and rivers reflect the biogeochemistry of regional ground waters with longer subsurface residence times.3. Inputs of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon to surface waters decrease during drought, with labile carbon limitation of microbial metabolism a byproduct of drought conditions.4. Decreased inputs of organic forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and a decrease in the organic : inorganic ratio of nutrient inputs favours autotrophs over heterotrophs during drought.5. The fate of autotrophic production during drought will be strongly influenced by the structure of the aquatic food web within impacted sites.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,7,,1219,1231,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01082.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000183640900008

This study compared differences in biomonitoring metrics between reference and agricultural streams, and between the flow period (January-April) and the intermittent flow period (May-December). Percentages of crustaceans, isopods, and Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) were significantly higher at the reference site than the two most impacted sites during the How period, probably resulting from the abundance of leaf litter and lower temperatures. During this same period, the agriculturally impacted sites had a significantly higher percentage of dipterans-a group that thrives in the silty, nutrient-rich waters. Four metrics (percent Crustacea, Isopoda, Diptera, and EPT) had no overlap between values for the most impacted and the least impacted sites during the flow period, but no metrics were able to detect more discrete differences among sites. Sites were physically and biologically similar during the intermittent period when natural stresses (i.e., stagnant water, high temperatures, low dissolved oxygen) were high, with many metrics, such as percentages of dominant family, burrowers, chironomids, and dipterans becoming similar at all sites.

Invertebrate,2003,"Death, RG",Spatial patterns in lotic invertebrate community composition: is substrate disturbance actually important?,"Twenty-five forest streams were sampled in August 1994 in Te Urewera National Park, New Zealand, to examine the effect of substrate disturbance on invertebrate community structure. Stream size, flow permanence, and riparian cover were more influential than substrate disturbance in affecting invertebrate composition. Three community types were distinguishable based on these three factors: small (<1 m wide), intermittent streams were dominated by Chironomidae; larger (12-15 in wide), open streams were dominated by Chironomidae, Plecoptera, and Ephemeroptera; and intermediate-sized (1-10 in wide) streams with continuous riparian cover were dominated by mayflies and caddisflies. Periphyton bio-mass was negatively affected by substrate disturbance but not to the same degree as reported by others studying unshaded streams. This may explain why the influence of substrate disturbance on community composition was less than that of stream size, flow permanence, and riparian cover. The key effect of substrate disturbance on postdisturbance community composition in these light-limited New Zealand streams appears to be the removal of animals rather than food loss. Thus, differences between communities that experience high flows and those that do not are far less than they might be in unshaded streams in which the food base is more severely affected by substrate disturbance.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,60,5,,603,611,,10.1139/F03-052,,,,,,0706-652X,,WOS:000184007000010

This aspect becomes crucial when several drinking water-catchments are located nearby the wadi banks.Such a case was observed in the low Seybouse plain (North-Eastern Algeria) where a natural obstruction of the wadi produced a rising of the water level, and concomitant direct infiltrations from the wadi to the aquifer. Two wells (MP1 and MP2) underwent a phosphate contamination from the wadi.Several water field samplings of the wadi (shallow waters), with a monthly period (Station MO1) and of the groundwater on two test sites (MP1 and MP2), with MP2 being discontinuously pumped (6 h d(-1)), were achieved during the water year, from February to December 1999.Comparing the chemical composition of the wadi water with that of several tapped groundwater samples, we could observe the existence of two pollutants in the wadi: phosphate (23 mg l(-1)) and ammonium (54 mg l(-1)). On the other hand, in the water catchments, only phosphate could be observed, and it could move only under the same chemical species between the wadi and both wells, where the concentrations reached, respectively, 2.3 and 3.1 mg l(-1).The lowering of the phosphate concentration between the wadi and the wells is due to the dilution effect of the contents by the aquifer water, the precipitation of phosphate under calcium phosphate species and finally by clay adsorption. But then, the absence of ammonium in the wells is due to the transformation of the nitrogen species into nitrate during the water pathway between both media, under the effect of oxidizing conditions.

Fish,2003,"Douglas, MR; Brunner, PC; Douglas, ME",Drought in an evolutionary context: molecular variability in Flannelmouth Sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) from the Colorado River Basin of western North America,"1. Fishes can often rebound numerically and distributionally from short-term (i.e. seasonal) drought, yet their capacity to recover from decades or centuries of drought is less apparent. An exceedingly warm and dry period swept the intermontane west of North America ca. 7500 years BP, concomitant with an abrupt extinction of >35 mammal species. Were larger fishes in mainstem rivers also impacted by this drought?2. The Colorado River Basin encompasses seven states in western North America and drains 600 000 km(2) . Its endemic mainstem fish community is ancient (i.e. Miocene) but depauperate.3. We evaluated one widely distributed candidate species (flannelmouth sucker, Catostomus latipinnis ) for basin-wide genetic and geographic structure at three fast-evolving mitochondrial (mt) DNA genes, ND2 with 589 bp and ATPase 8 and 6 with 642 bp. It is hypothesized that a concomitant signature would be present in the mtDNA of this species, if indeed it had been seriously bottlenecked by post-Pleistocene drought. A total of 352 individuals were sequenced from 24 populations (4-40 individuals/population; average of 14.7).4. Only 49 unique haplotypes were found, 53% of which represented single individuals. Haplotype diversity was high (0.905 +/- 0.007) whereas nucleotide diversity was low (0.002 +/- 0.000).5. A significant and positive geographical cline (P < 0.001) in nucleotide diversity was observed as sampling locations progressed upstream from southwest to northeast. These results divided the Colorado River Basin into three reaches: the lower reach with six populations and 83 individuals; the upper reach with seven populations and 83 individuals; and the middle reach with 11 populations and 186 individuals. An analysis of molecular variance (amova) revealed that 81.5% of the total genetic variation was within populations, 16% among populations within reaches and 2.5% among reaches. Only the last was significant. Populations from the three reaches diverged from one another by 3400-11 000 years BP. Haplotype distribution suggested populations in the upper Colorado River are expanding.6. The lack of genetic variation and recent coalescence of lineages in C. latipinnis are unusual given its fossil history, broad geographical sampling, the rapid rate of mtDNA evolution and the number (and evolutionary rate) of the genes examined. The most parsimonious explanation for these data is a rapid expansion following a recent period of low effective population size at the end of the Pleistocene.7. The intense drought is suggested at the end of the Pleistocene (late-to-mid-Holocene), severely impacted not only large mammals but also larger fishes in western North American rivers. These perspectives have important implications for management of endangered and threatened species in this region.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,7,,1254,1273,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01088.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000183640900010
Fish,2003,"Eby, LA; Fagan, WF; Minckley, WL",Variability and dynamics of a desert stream community,"Communities can be highly variable over a few years, but remain fairly constant over the long term. Evaluating measures and examining the variability associated with long-term change is useful because it increases our understanding of and our ability to predict responses to disturbances. We used long-term fish community data from Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, USA, a Sonoran Desert stream, to determine whether there had been long-term changes in the community composition, what measures best describe these shifts, and what environmental factors are correlated with the changes. Aravaipa Creek is an intrinsically variable system and one of the few remaining desert streams to support its complete historical assemblage of native fishes. Multivariate analyses illustrated important, changes in composition of the native fish community that were not described by traditional measures of persistence and stability. In the early 1980s, changes in community composition were correlated with alterations in base flow, while more recent changes are likely associated with the presence of exotic species. Changes in stream morphology, hydrology, and climate have decreased flow variability, thereby increasing the likelihood of exotic establishment, and may have increased the downstream connection between Aravaipa Creek and the San Pedro River thus increasing the likelihood of repeated invasions by normative species. These results support previous research in intrinsically variable desert systems, which conclude that retention of high flow variability is important to conservation of the native fish community. In addition, although connectivity in aquatic lotic systems is important, isolation from large river systems teaming with exotics may be important in preserving these remnant native fish assemblages.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,13,6,,1566,1579,,10.1890/02-5211,,,,,,1051-0761,,WOS:000187616400007

Continuous tracer additions were conducted in seven rivers ranging from 1st to 5th order with samples collected from instream, hyporheic, and parafluvial locations. Tracer data was used as input for a computer model to estimate hydrologic characteristics of each study reach. While solute concentrations during the tracer additions indicated that steady-state or ""plateau"" conditions had been reached, interstitial samples indicated that there were additional hyporheic and parafluvial zones that had not been fully labeled at the time of apparent steady state in the stream channel (plateau). Exchange between channel and hyporheic water was a function of location within a pool-riffle sequence, with rapid downwelling at the head of riffles and delayed upwelling in riffle tails. The extent of exchange between channel and hyporheic water was positively correlated with apparent streambed hydraulic conductivity. Tracer additions indicated interstitial velocities ranging from 0.030 to 0.075 cm s(-1) and hydraulic conductivities from 2.4 to 12.2 cm s(-1). Hyporheic and in-channel samples were collected for N, P, DO, and CO2 analyses in conjunction with conservative tracer additions in four of the stream reaches for which the interstitial velocities were also determined. Transformation rates based on these data indicated that there was rapid nitrification of mineralized organic N and production of ammonium, phosphate, and carbon dioxide in the interstitial zones of all four reaches. Dissolved oxygen did not appear to be limiting in the reaches studied. The hyporheic zone of all four reaches was a source of nitrate, carbon dioxide, and ammonium to the channel water based on the average concentration of upwelling waters. Increased contact time with hyporheic and parafluvial zones was related to decreased temperature and increased conductivity. Net nitrogen flux from the hyporheic zone was equivalent to 14-162% of benthic N uptake requirements for the Kuparuk River. These observations are important because we expected that the presence of continuous permafrost in this Arctic environment would limit the importance of hyporheic processes, either physically (i.e., through the presence of a restricting thaw bulb in the permafrost) or biogeochemically (i.e., through low temperatures). Instead, we found that biogeochernical processes in the hyporheic zone of these Arctic streams are at least as important as it is in similar temperate stream ecosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Four crayfish species were collected: Orconectes marchandi, O. punctimanus, O. ozarkae and Cambarus hubbsi. Overall, crayfish densities were significantly greater in intermittent streams than in permanent streams with density of O. marchandi and O. punctimanus significantly greater in intermittent streams than in permanent streams. Densities of O. ozarkae and C. hubbsi did not differ significantly between the two stream types. Large individuals of O. punctimanus and O. ozarkae were found in significantly greater densities than small individuals. There was a significant relationship between crayfish relative density and abiotic environmental variables for permanent streams, but not for intermittent streams.

Current understanding is captured in conceptual models for different ecosystem types, which share some features and diverge in other ways. Distinctiveness of subdisciplines has been appropriate in some respects and has fostered important advances in theory. On the other hand, lack of integration between aquatic and terrestrial biogeochemistry limits our ability to deal with biogeochemical phenomena across large landscapes in which connections between terrestrial and aquatic elements are important.

Sampling of periphyton communities at sandbar edges in Sycamore Creek, Arizona, revealed community differences related to direction of hydrologic exchange with the subsurface. N-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant at sandbar inwelling edges. Non N-fixing taxa predominated at outwelling edges. We evaluated several predictions of the hypothesis that this difference was attributable to differences in N availability at sandbar edges. NO3-N at outwelling edges was 3.5 times higher than at inwelling edges, consistent with past work showing microbial nitrification to characterize sandbars. Non N-fixing and N-fixing periphyton biovolume were related to NO3-N concentration at edges. Reciprocal transplants of periphyton from original edges to edges with the opposite direction of hydrologic exchange revealed significant declines in periphyton relative to controls. Experiments using NO3-N diffusing substrates revealed non N-fixing taxa to be more abundant where NO3-N was elevated. N-fixing periphyton was, in contrast, more abundant at naturally low NO3-N or unenriched sites. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N availability between inwelling and outwelling edges caused the observed pattern of periphyton distribution at sandbar edges. Last, 80% of outwelling NO3-N was removed from outflowing water by periphyton at sandbar edges. This temporary retention of available N results in a surface stream depleted of inorganic N and accentuates spatial heterogeneity of periphyton communities in this ecosystem.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,22,4,,511,527,,10.2307/1468349,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000186839900003

Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ micro invertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River floodplain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 10(4)-10(5) m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 10(5)-10(6) m). The strength of connectivity is likely to vary across spatial scales with the magnitude, duration, and rate of rise and fall of floods.",ECOLOGY,84,10,,2708,2723,,10.1890/02-0326,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000186599300019
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2003,"Lake, PS",Ecological effects of perturbation by drought in flowing waters,"1. Knowledge of the ecology of droughts in flowing waters is scattered and fragmentary, with much of the available information being gathered opportunistically. Studies on intermittent and arid-zone streams have provided most of the information.2. Drought in streams may be viewed as a disturbance in which water inflow, river flow and water availability fall to extremely low levels for extended periods of time. As an ecological perturbation, there is the disturbance of drought and the responses of the biota to the drought.3. Droughts can either be periodic, seasonal or supra-seasonal events. The types of disturbance for seasonal droughts are presses and for supra-seasonal droughts, ramps.4. In droughts, hydrological connectivity is disrupted. Such disruption range from flow reduction to complete loss of surface water and connectivity. The longitudinal patterns along streams as to where flow ceases and drying up occurs differs between streams. Three patterns are outlined: 'downstream drying', 'headwater drying' and 'mid-reach drying'.5. There are both direct and indirect effects of drought on stream ecosystems. Marked direct effects include loss of water, loss of habitat for aquatic organisms and loss of stream connectivity. Indirect effects include the deterioration of water quality, alteration of food resources, and changes in the strength and structure of interspecific interactions.6. Droughts have marked effects on the densities and size- or age-structure of populations, on community composition and diversity, and on ecosystem processes.7. Organisms can resist the effects of drought by the use of refugia. Survival in refugia may strongly influence the capacity of the biota to recover from droughts once they break.8. Recovery by biota varies markedly between seasonal and supra-seasonal droughts. Faunal recovery from seasonal droughts follows predictable sequences, whilst recovery from supra-seasonal droughts varies from one case to another and may be marked by dense populations of transient species and the depletion of biota that normally occur in the streams.9. The restoration of streams must include the provision of drought refugia and the inclusion of drought in the long-term flow regime.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,7,,1161,1172,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01086.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000183640900003

In this study, rainfall data spanning 100 years were used as a proxy to quantify long-term flood regimes for southeastern Arizona (USA) streams. The frequency and seasonal timing of severe floods (>50% substrate movement) were highly variable at short temporal scales (days to several years), but clear patterns emerged in the long-term (several years to a century). To explore the ecological effects of flood timing, populations of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus (Calamoceratidae) were monitored in 2 streams over 3 years. The timing of individual floods relative to the long-term average strongly affected P. aeneus populations: early and timely floods had little effect on population size in the next year, but late floods significantly reduced population size in the next year. Thus, flood timing might play a role in regulating populations of desert stream organisms.",SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST,48,1,,36,42,,10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0036:RLFRWR>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0038-4909,,WOS:000182043500004

Assessment,2003,"McMahon, TA; Finlayson, BL",Droughts and anti-droughts: the low flow hydrology of Australian rivers,"1. Droughts are not easily defined other than by culturally driven judgements about the extent and nature of impact. Natural ecosystems are adapted to the magnitude and frequency of dry periods and these are instrumental in controlling the long term functioning of these systems.2. In unregulated rivers, low flows are derived from water in long-term storage in the catchment, commonly as shallow groundwater. Four types of low flow sequences are evident for representative rivers from each of the seven flow regime zones in Australia and an arid zone stream: perennial streams with low annual flow variability that have seasonal low flows but do not cease to flow; perennial streams with high annual variability that cease to flow in extreme years; ephemeral streams that regularly cease to flow in the dry season; and arid zone streams with long and erratic periods of no flow.3. Although Australian rivers record runs of consecutive years of low flows longer than would be expected theoretically, the departures from the expected are not statistically significant. Trends and quasi-cycles in sequences of low-flow years are observed over decadal time scales.4. Examples of the effects of river regulation on low flows in southern Australia indicate that, while in detail the impacts of regulation vary, in general regulation mitigates the severity of low flows.5. It is our contention that the indigenous biota of Australian rivers are adapted to the naturally occurring low flow conditions and that, while there is considerable scientific interest in the effects of climate change on stream ecology, such studies have little practical relevance for the management of indigenous biota in unregulated rivers.6. The changes brought about by the regulation of rivers are much more rapid and dramatic than those which might occur as a result of climate change and it is possible to develop management procedures to mitigate them. In regulated rivers, the real problem may be 'anti-droughts'- the removal of significant natural low-flow events from the flow pattern.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,48,7,,1147,1160,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01098.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000183640900002

To establish the effect of macroinvertebrates on litter breakdown, we used air-dried leaves from the two dominant species of riparian vegetation (Populus alba and Populus nigra) along each watercourse and litter bags of two mesh sizes (100 mum and 5 mm). Macroinvertebrates were collected from the bags and ash free dry weight and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the plant detritus remaining were measured. Litter decomposition rates, in days and degree-days, were estimated using a simple exponential model. A significant effect of macroinvertebrates and seasonality on litter decay was observed only in the Ebro river. Decomposition rates were faster in this river, P. alba showing the highest rates in spring-summer (0.022-0.038 day(-1)). The macroinvertebrates collected from the bags were mostly collector-gatherers of the genus Chironomus. Their density increased over time and was greater in the experiments performed in spring-summer (two to ten fold higher). Higher temperatures together with increased macroinvertebrate densities led to augmented decomposition rates in the Ebro river but no effect was observed in the Senia stream.

Assessment,2003,"Morfin, O; Conklin, MH; Corley, TL; Hiskey, JB; Ruiz, J","The use of Pb isotopes, total metals analysis and total metals ratios to characterize Pb transport and fate in an interrupted stream, Aravaipa Creek, SE Arizona","The most probable source of Pb contamination in the perennial reach of Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, has been determined using Pb isotope ratios and total metals analyses of samples collected from the ephemeral and perennial reaches and mine wastes located in the Aravaipa Mining District. Previously, elevated levels of Pb, Cd and As in fish in the perennial reach of Aravaipa Creek, a protected wilderness area,, were assumed to be due to off-site transport from abandoned flotation tailings piles located at Klondyke, Arizona upstream of the wilderness area. Our work replaces this inference with isotopic data that allows us to confirm this hypothesis. The Pb/Zn deposits of the district were mined between the late 1890s and the late 1960s, with the most significant ore production coming from one deposit in a rhyolite dike swarm on the Western front of the Santa Teresa Mountains, a granitic pluton of Cretaceous-Tertiary age (similar to65 ma). Mineralogy has been well constrained across the length of the lode system: Pb and Zn sulfides predominate in the NW sector, and a mixed suite of hypogene/supergene Pb sulfide and Pb oxide minerals comprises the majority of its SE corner. Total metals analyses and comparison of metals ratios serve to constrain the source and transport of certain metals within different parts of the system. Pb isotope ratios in samples, obtained by ICP-MS analysis, define two distinct contributors. The first end-member (Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.513 to 38.721 and Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.550 to 15.598) is characteristic of the mixed, oxide/sulfide ores at the SE end of the deposit. A second end-member (Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.855 to 38.946 and Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.610 to 15.625) characterizes samples taken from the NW, purely Pb sulfide end of the lode.

In the Mediterranean ecoregion, summer drought events and dams constitute the main sources of local disturbance to the structure and functioning of river ecosystems occurring in the river basin. In this study, we analysed patterns of spatial variation of detritus processing in a 7th order river of the Mediterranean ecoregion (River Tirso, Sardinia-Italy) and in three 4th order sub-basins which were exposed to different summer drought pressures. The study was carried out on Phragmites australis and Alnus glutinosa leaf detritus at 31 field sites in seasonal field experiment Detritus processing rates were higher for Alnus glutinosa than for Phragmites australis plant detritus. Processing rates of Alnus glutinosa leaves varied among seasons and study sites from 0.006 d(-1) to 0.189 d(-1) and those of Phragmites australis leaves ranged from 0.0008 d(-1) to 0.102 d(-1), with the lowest values occurring at sites exposed to summer drought. Seasons and sites accounted for a significant proportion of such variability. Alder detritus decay rates generally decreased with increasing stream order, while reed detritus decay rates generally increased on the same spatial gradient. Summer drought events affected these spatial patterns of variation by influencing significantly the decay rates of both plant detritus. The comparisons among and within sub-basins showed strong negative influence of summer drought on detritus processing rates. Similarly, in the entire River Tirso basin decay rates were always lower at disturbed than at undisturbed sites for each stream order; decay rates of reed detritus remained lower at those sites even after the end of the,disturbance events, while alder decay rates recovered rapidly from the summer drought perturbations. The different recovery of the processing rates of the two leaves could also explain the different patterns of spatial variation observed between the two leaves.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES-CHINA,15,2,,227,240,,,,2nd International Conference on Landscape Ecology of Asia and Pacific Region,"SEP 22-25, 2001",,"LANZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA",1001-0742,,WOS:000181538700015

The reproductive traits of diploids and triploids from a population in a tributary of the Guadiana River, Portugal, were compared, during a two-years period. Few differences were found in the growth and reproductive traits of diploid and triploid females. Marginal differences were found in the longevity, with a few triploid females living up to six years compared with a maximum of five years for diploid females and a maximum of four years for diploid males. Both diploid and triploid females exhibited rapid growth in the first two years of life followed by rapid drop off linked to attaining sexual maturity. Reproductive effort increased with age but was mainly linked to number of eggs produced and not to egg size, since oocyte size did not vary with age or length of fish in either ploidy forms. Both forms exhibited a protracted spawning period between March and June, suggesting multiple-spawning behaviour. Triploid females had a slightly smaller oocyte diameter that may be due to the production of reduced (haploid) oocytes while diploid females produced diploid (unreduced) oocytes The potentially higher production of diploid oocytes (which become triploid eggs after fertilisation) by diploid females could at least partially account for the higher percentage of triploids in natural populations. In addition, the production of bigger (diploid) oocytes, with possibly higher energetic content could lead to bigger fish larvae, which tend to have a higher survival rate. The time of spawning of both diploids and triploids appears to be synchronised, although differences were found in the onset of the spawning period between years, due to annual variations in temperature conditions.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,156,4,,471,484,,10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0471,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000182598500003

In this study, we use natural abundance delta(13)C and delta(15)N values and an isotopic N-15 tracer addition to quantify the flow of carbon and nitrogen from aquatic to terrestrial food webs via emerging aquatic insects. We continuously dripped labeled N-15-NH4 for 6 weeks into Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran desert stream in the Tonto National Forest (central Arizona) and traced the flow of tracer N-15 from the stream into spiders living in the riparian zone. After correcting for natural abundance delta(15)N, we used isotopic mixing models to calculate the proportion of N-15 from emerging aquatic insects incorporated into spider biomass. Natural abundance delta(13)C values indicate that orb-web weaving spiders inhabiting riparian vegetation along the stream channel obtain almost 100% of their carbon from instream sources, whereas ground-dwelling hunting spiders obtain on average 68% of their carbon from instream sources. During the 6-week period of the N-15 tracer addition, orb-web weaving spiders obtained on average 39% of their nitrogen from emerging aquatic insects, whereas spider species hunting on the ground obtained on average 25% of their nitrogen from emerging aquatic insects. To determine if stream subsidies might be influencing the spatial distribution of terrestrial predators, we measured the biomass, abundance and diversity of spiders along a gradient from the active stream channel to a distance of 50 m into the upland using pitfall traps and timed sweep net samples. Spider abundance, biomass and richness were highest within the active stream channel but decreased more than three-fold 25 m from the wetted stream margin.

The rates of gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) were determined for each algal assemblage using oxygen change in chambers. The net daily metabolism (NDM) and the GPPd(-1) : CR24 ratio were estimated by patch-weighting the assemblage-level metabolism values.3. Gross primary production and CR showed significant differences between assemblages and dates. The highest rates were measured in summer and spring, while December was the only month when there were no significant differences in either parameters between assemblages. GPP was strongly correlated with respiration, but not with algal biomass.4. Chara vulgaris showed the highest mean annual metabolic rates (GPP = 2.80 +/- 0.83 gC m(-2) h(-1), CR = 0.76 +/- 0.29 gC m(-2) h(-1)), followed by the epilithic assemblage (GPP = 1.97 +/- 0.73 gC m(-2) h(-1), CR = 0.41 +/- 0.12 gC m(-2) h(-1)) and epipelic algae (GPP = 1.36 +/- 0.22 gC m(-2) h(-1), CR = 0.39 +/- 0.06 gC m(-2) h(-1)).5.

Data were collected from 11 streams ranging from arctic to tropical and from desert to rainforest. Measurements at each site included physical, hydraulic and chemical characteristics, biological parameters, whole-stream metabolism and ammonium uptake. Ammonium uptake was measured by injection of N-15-ammonium and downstream measurements of N-15-ammonium concentration.3. We found no general, statistically significant relationships that explained the variability in ammonium uptake among sites. However, this approach does not account for the multiple mechanisms of ammonium uptake in streams. When we estimated biological demand for inorganic nitrogen based on our measurements of in-stream metabolism, we found good correspondence between calculated nitrogen demand and measured assimilative nitrogen uptake.4. Nitrogen uptake varied little among sites, reflecting metabolic compensation in streams in a variety of distinctly different biomes (autotrophic production is high where allochthonous inputs are relatively low and vice versa).5.

Little is know about the ability of riparian areas in these settings to reduce nitrate in water draining from grass seed fields. We established two study sites with similar soils and hydrology but contrasting riparian vegetation along an intermittent stream that drains perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) fields in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We installed a series of nested piezometers along three transects at each site to examine NO3-N in shallow ground water in grass seed fields and riparian areas. Results showed that a noncultivated riparian zone comprised of grasses and herbaceous vegetation significantly reduced NO3-N concentrations of shallow ground water moving from grass seed fields. Darcy's law-based estimates of shallow ground water flow through riparian zone A/E horizons revealed that this water flowpath could account for only a very small percentage of the streamflow. Even though there is great potential for NO3-N to be reduced as water moves through the noncultivated riparian zone with grass-herbaceous vegetation, the potential was not fully realized because only a small proportion of the stream flow interacts with riparian zone soils. Consequently, effective NO3-N water quality management in poorly drained landscapes similar to the study watershed is primarily dependent on implementation of sound agricultural practices within grass seed fields and is less influenced by riparian zone vegetation. Wise fertilizer application rates and timing are key management tools to reduce export of NO3-N in stream waters.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,32,1,,162,170,,,,,,,,0047-2425,,WOS:000181953400019

We conducted a field experiment in an intermittent reach of Alum Creek in the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, to examine the effects of predatory fish on macroinvertebrate assemblages. We tested the prediction that with pool isolation fish would have a top-down influence on macromvertebrate assemblages. Overall, fish had a significant effect on both the density and assemblage structure of the macroinvertebrates in isolated stream pools. Assemblage effects may be linked to a feeding preference for relatively rare food items. These patterns were evident despite the loss of replicates (i.e., the drying of individual pools), indicating a strong short-term predator effect. We suggest that the use of different methodologies among studies makes it difficult to determine the influence of fish predation on macroinvertebrate assemblages in stream systems. Furthermore, we suggest that more realistic field experiments (i.e., with natural stream setting, hydrology, and substrata) must be conducted to fully understand and adequately address the question of the effects of fish predation on macroinvertebrates.",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,132,1,,120,130,,10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0120:IOFPOA>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0002-8487,,WOS:000180362000013

Single-station diel oxygen curves were used to monitor the oxygen metabolism of an intermittent, forested third-order stream (Fuirosos) in the Mediterranean area, over a period of 22 months. Ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) were estimated and related to organic matter inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in order to understand the effect of the riparian forest on stream metabolism.2. Annual ER was 1690 g O-2 m(-2) year(-1) and annual GPP was 275 g O-2 m(-2) year(-1). Fuirosos was therefore a heterotrophic stream, with P : R ratios averaging 0.16.3. GPP rates were relatively low, ranging from 0.05 to 1.9 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1). The maximum values of GPP occurred during a few weeks in spring, and ended when the riparian canopy was fully closed. The phenology of the riparian vegetation was an important determinant of light availability, and consequently, of GPP.4. On a daily scale, light and temperature were the most important factors governing the shape of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves. Several patterns could be generalised in the P-I relationships. Hysteresis-type curves were characteristic of late autumn and winter. Light saturation responses (that occurred at irradiances higher than 90 muE m(-2) s(-1)) were characteristic of early spring. Linear responses occurred during late spring, summer and early autumn when there was no evidence of light saturation.5. Rates of ER were high when compared with analogous streams, ranging from 0.4 to 32 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1). ER was highest in autumn 2001, when organic matter accumulations on the streambed were extremely high. By contrast, the higher discharge in autumn 2002 prevented these accumulations and caused lower ER. The Mediterranean climate, and in its effect the hydrological regime, were mainly responsible for the temporal variation in benthic organic matter, and consequently of ER.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,49,7,,960,971,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01239.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000222069900009

The samples were collected monthly at 8 sampling sites (630 to 20 m above sea level) and community variation was analysed in space and time. Overall, the study sites showed a very poor macroinvertebrate fauna: more than 60% of samples contained less than 11 species, and 99% had less than 30 species. Furthermore, most species displayed very low abundance: 66% of the species were represented by less than 20 individuals (abundance). Among the identified taxa, Chironomidae was the dominant taxon at all sampling sites except at the most upstream site (630 m a.s.l.) where it was replaced by Coleoptera. Concerning monthly changes, the species richness was very low in August and October. Through the learning process of the SOM, samples were classified into four clusters by the SOM, and the classification was mainly related to the location of the sampling sites. Benthic macroinvertebrates were divided into four classes, which revealed the influence of pollution on their longitudinal distribution in this stream.

Biogeochemistry,2004,"Artigas, J; Romani, AM; Sabater, S",Organic matter decomposition by fungi in a Mediterranean forested stream : contribution of streambed substrata,"Aquatic microfungi play a fundamental role in organic matter decomposition in fluvial ecosystems. These micro-organisms degrade leaf recalcitrant compounds like lignin, thereby enhancing the utilization of organic material by the microbial, community. The main input of allochthonous organic matter in Mediterranean streams occurs during the autumn. In-stream breakdown processes can be affected by high physical abrasion during flooding but changes in stream water chemistry may also affect decomposition enzymatic activities of stream microorganisms. We measured two ligninolytic activities (phenol oxidase and peroxidase) and a cellulolytic activity (cellobiohydrolase) in leaves, branches, sand and gravel substrata in a reach of a Mediterranean stream. Highest ligninolytic activities were measured in biofilm developed on inorganic substrata (sand and gravel) where also accumulated the highest fungal biomass (ranging from 3.3 x 10(-4) to 7.22 mg Ergosterol gAFDM(-1)) especially in sand substrata. Conversely, cellulolytic activities were significantly higher in biofilm on organic substrata (leaves and branches). Physical and chemical factors, such as discharge and stream water nutrient concentration (Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen) were affecting enzymatic activities, particularly enhancing the phenol oxidase. Moreover, the chemical composition of the available OM (high cellulose in leaves, high lignin in detritic material) strongly influenced the decomposition activity in each biofilm. A precise description and quantification of the benthic substrata was used to obtain enzymatic activity values in terms of stream reach. Those results showed a temporal pattern in the decomposition activities in the reach, beginning with the decomposition of cellulose (October) followed by lignin compounds (November and December).",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,40,4,,269,277,,10.1051/limn/2004025,,,,,,0003-4088,,WOS:000225929900002

The recent installation of a reservoir upstream of the study area has strongly modified the flow regime by extending the period of low water level, and this stream section is only occasionally fed by water releases. Investigations on the hyporheos and benthos of this stream have allowed the comparison of densities, taxa richness and diversity, during three hydrological periods (natural high water, low flow and reservoir water releases), with the aim to highlight effects of the reservoir management on downstream hydrosystems. Species richness and abundance of stygobite crustaceans were low in the hyporheos. Surface water Crustaceans represented 53% of the overall fauna, with Cyclopoidae composing 50% of the Crustaceans. The dominance of the Cyclopoidae was also observed in the hyporheos. Daphniidae were more abundant (37%) in the benthic habitat than in the hyporheic zone. The alternation of high and low discharges appeared to affect the hyporheos more than the benthic communities.

Accordingly, soil N processes and leaching of solutes in Mediterranean regions also show a marked seasonality, occurring in pulses as soils re Y -wet following rain. The Integrated Nitrogen Catchment model (INCA) was applied to Fuirosos. a Mediterranean catchment located in NE Spain, using hydrological data and streamwater nitrate and ammonium concentrations collected front 1999 to 2002. This study tested the model under Mediterranean climate conditions and assessed the effect of the high inter-annual variability on the ability of INCA to simulate discharge and N fluxes. The model was calibrated for the whole three-year period and the n coefficients of determination (r(2)) between simulated and observed data were 0.54 and 0.1 for discharge and nitrate temporal dynamics, respectively. Ammonium dynamics were simulated poorly and the linear regression between observed and simulated data was not significant statistically To assess the effect of inter-annual variability Oil INCA simulations, the calibration process was run separately for two contrasting hydrological years: a dry year with a total rainfall of 525 mm and a wet year with a total of 871 mm. The coefficients of determination for the correlation between observed and simulated discharge for these two periods were 0.67 (p<0.0001) and 0.62 (p<0.0001), respectively. Nitrate temporal dynamics were not simulated as well in the dry year (r(2) = 0. 13 p<0.0001) as in the wet year (r= 0.56 p<0.0001). Annual nitrate balances were similar to those estimated from observations. Results suggest that, in Mediterranean catchments, both hydrology and nitrate mobilisation are influenced strongly by soil moisture, which is highly variable within and between years; also, a single parameter set is insufficient to capture the inter-annual variability in Fuirosos. It is suggested that, when using INCA in semiarid systems such as those in Mediterranean regions, certain of the parameters currently fixed in INCA (e.g. base flow index or drainage area) be treated as variables dependent on soil moisture deficit.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,8,4,,729,741,,,,,,,,1027-5606,,WOS:000226829900013

Although they are widely used in water quality assessment, little is known of the ecological profiles of families or species. We present a simple score for ecological profiles which measures intolerance to water quality. The ecological profiles of caddisflies are diverse and the degree of tolerance at the family level is related to species diversity and the tolerance of individual species to water quality. Comparisons with the scores used in the biotic index IBMWP show general agreement between the degree of intolerance of a family and its score in the IBMWP, with few exceptions.

Basin area alone explained more than 80% of variation in native species richness. Larger basins featured not only a higher number of native species, but also more endemic and rare species and fewer diversified genera than smaller basins.3. In contrast, smaller basins scored higher community conservation values, owing to their lower degree of invasion by introduced species.4. The presence of dams was the most important factor determining the conservation status of fish communities, and it was also positively associated with the number of introduced species.5. While the most important components of Iberian freshwater fish biodiversity are located in large basins, small unregulated basins feature better conserved fish communities.

Biogeochemistry,2004,"Fisher, SG; Sponseller, RA; Heffernan, JB",Horizons in stream biogeochemistry: Flowpaths to progress,"Over the past 50 years, conceptual developments in stream ecology and ecosystem ecology have converged, thanks to biogeochemistry and the recognition that in situ processing on one hand and spatial translation of materials, processes, and influence along flowpaths on the other, unite to generate a holistic picture of ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however.There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain.Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.",ECOLOGY,85,9,,2369,2379,,10.1890/03-0244,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000224379600004

The area disturbed by logging within the stream border ranged from 23 to 30%. Overall, there were no significant differences in amphibian abundance, species richness, or composition between disturbed and undisturbed sites within the riparian area. However, one toad species (Bufo typhonia) was significantly more abundant in disturbed than in undisturbed areas. All of the remaining species captured were frogs and their abundance did not differ between undisturbed and disturbed areas. More amphibians were captured during the peak dry season months than during other times of the year. This. study suggests that riparian areas are important refuge for amphibians during dry season months and, therefore, should be protected within forests managed for timber. Limited interventions in riparian areas (as much as 23-30%) by logging did not significantly impact amphibian populations 1 year following logging. However, long-term effects on amphibian populations past 1 year after logging need to be investigated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Invertebrate,2004,"Fritz, KM; Dodds, WK",Resistance and resilience of macroinvertebrate assemblages to drying and flood in a tallgrass prairie stream system,"Intermittent streams are common worldwide, and the ability of invertebrates to recover from floods and drought is a key feature of communities from these highly disturbed ecosystems. The macroinvertebrate assemblages of Kings Creek in northeastern Kansas were sampled regularly from four intermittent and two perennial sites over 2 years (1995-1996) to investigate the response and recovery to seasonal drying and floods. A similar to 9 mo drying period reduced taxa richness and density to 14% and 3% of pre-drying assemblages, respectively, in 1995-1996, whereas a 2 mo drying period reduced richness by half and density to 4% of pre-drying assemblages in 1996. Floods at intermittent sites reduced densities and richness by 95% and similar to50%, respectively. A > 50 y-flood reduced macroinvertebrate richness by 97% and density by > 99% at a downstream perennial site. Resistance and resilience of total macroinvertebrate density was typically greater to floods than to drying, whereas resilience of taxa richness did not differ between disturbance types. The time required for recovery to pre-flood conditions ( richness and density) was half as long ( 27 vs. 76 day) for intermittent sites compared to perennial sites. Colonization of intermittent sites was a function of distance from upstream refugia. Floods were a more important disturbance on assemblages in a downstream reach as compared to upstream reaches. In contrast, upstream reaches were more likely to dry. Recovery following flood and drought was dominated by colonization as opposed to tolerance, thus resilience is more important than resistance in regulating macroinvertebrate communities in these streams, and relative position in the landscape affects disturbance type, intensity, and ability of communities to recover from disturbance.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,527,1,,99,112,,10.1023/B:HYDR.0000043188.53497.9b,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000224130600011

Four metrics commonly used for stream assessment were computed for 9 stream reaches within a fairly homogeneous, minimally impaired stream segment of the San Pedro River, Arizona. Metric variability was assessed for differing sampling scenarios using simple permutation procedures. Spatial patterns of metric values suggest that aquatic invertebrate communities are patchily distributed on subsegment and segment scales, which causes metric variability. Wide ranges of metric values resulted in wide ranges of metric coefficients of variation (CVs) and minimum detectable differences (MDDs), and both CVs and MDDs often increased as sample size (number of reaches) increased, suggesting that any particular set of sampling reaches could yield misleading estimates of population parameters and effects that can be detected. Mean metric variabilities were substantial, with the result that only fairly large differences in metrics would be declared significant at alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20. The number of reaches required to obtain MDDs of 10% and 20% varied with significance level and power, and differed for different metrics, but were generally large, ranging into tens and hundreds of reaches. Study results suggest that metric values from one or a small number of stream reach(es) may not be adequate to represent a stream segment, depending on effect sizes of interest, and that larger sample sizes are necessary to obtain reasonable estimates of metrics and sample statistics.

Changes result from hydrologic modifications, including direct alterations of flow regimes and hydrologic flowpaths and indirect changes in hydrologic patterns via increased impervious cover in contributing areas of watersheds. Direct changes to channel morphology (i.e., reduced complexity) and to floodplains of streams and rivers also influence biogeochernistry, for example, by eliminating surface water-groundwater exchange. The nature of and strength of connections between the stream and its watershed may be altered by large-scale changes such as those brought about by urban and suburban development. Finally, in urban and agricultural areas, elevated nutrient loading is exacerbated by land-cover changes that increase the potential for erosion or overland flow, and decrease the opportunities for nutrient retention. Using comparative analysis based on published work, mined public data, and new research, we evaluate urbanization effects on stream ecosystems in the Sonoran Desert region of central Arizona. Five key characteristics of non-urban desert streams-nitrogen limitation, a flashy hydrologic regime that initiates succession, extensive groundwater-surface water interaction, episodic terrestrial-aquatic interactions, and high capacity for nutrient retention-are both dramatically altered and scarcely affected by urbanization. The similarities exhibited by aridland streams and their urban counterparts arise from large-scale constraints (e.g., episodic terrestrial-aquatic interaction is imposed by the climatic regime in both stream types), whereas the differences, like interrupted flowpath continuity in the urban landscape, likely result from the myriad direct modifications of streams and catchment land cover in cities.",ECOSYSTEMS AND LAND USE CHANGE,153,,,129,146,,10.1029/153GM11,,Conference on Ecosystems Interactions with Land Use Change,"JUN, 2003","Amer Geophys Union, Chapman","Santa Fe, NM",0065-8448,0-87590-418-1,WOS:000226789500010
Biogeochemistry,2004,"Heffernan, JB; Sponseller, RA",Nutrient mobilization and processing in Sonoran desert riparian soils following artificial re-wetting,"Research in river-floodplain systems has emphasized the importance of nutrient delivery by floodwaters, but the mechanisms by which floods make nutrients available are rarely evaluated. Using a laboratory re-wetting experiment, we evaluated the alternative hypotheses that increased nutrient concentrations in riparian groundwater during flash floods are due to (H1) elevated nutrient concentrations in surface floodwaters entering the riparian zone or (H2) re-mobilization of nutrients from riparian soils. We sampled soils from the riparian zone of a 400 m reach of Sycamore Creek, AZ. Two sub-samples from each soil were re-wetted with a solution that mimicked the chemistry of floodwaters, with one subsample simultaneously treated with a biocide. We also measured structural characteristics of soils ( texture, organic matter, moisture, and extractable nutrients) to investigate relationships between these characteristics and response to re-wetting. Riparian soils exhibited considerable variation in physical and chemical structure. Soil organic matter, moisture, and texture co-varied among samples. Re-wetting increased concentrations of nitrate and ammonium, and decreased SRP, relative to initial concentrations. Live soils were significantly lower in NO3- and SRP than biocide-treated samples. Extractable DIN pools were the best predictors of mobilization, and soil organic matter was strongly correlated with nitrate losses, probably via its relationship with microbial uptake. Nutrient mobilization and processing also varied considerably with depth, lateral position, and among plots.

Invertebrate,2004,"Kilbane, GM; Holomuzki, JR","Spatial attributes, scale, and species traits determine caddisfly distributional responses to flooding","We compared densities of the caddisflies Ironoquia punctatissima (Walker) and Neophylax mitchelli (Carpenter) in microhabitats (cobbles, leaf litter, bedrock) nested within pool and run macrohabitats with different bedforms (stony [cobble-dominated] or flat bedrock) before and immediately after 4 floods in a north-central Ohio intermittent stream. Our goal was to identify which microhabitat and macrohabitat types acted as flow refugia. Ironoquia densities were highest on leaf litter in stony pools prior to floods. Flooding significantly lowered larval densities in stony and bedrock pools, where most leaf litter occurred, but not in runs. The most marked changes in pre- and postflood Ironoquia densities occurred in leaf litter, where densities decreased by similar to65 to 97% in 3 of 4 floods. In contrast, preflood densities of Neophylax were highest in bedrock runs and pools. However, floods significantly decreased Neophylax densities in these macrohabitats, suggesting bedrock macrohabitats provided larvae little shelter from high-flow forces. Measurement of cobble and leafpack tracer particles confirmed that hydraulic forces were highest in bedrock runs and that cobbles were far more stable than leaf packs in all macrohabitat types. Both species apparently face conflicting demands between residing in habitat patches that are food-rich but have poor flow refugia. Behavioral observations in a laboratory flume, where larvae were exposed to incrementally increased flows, revealed that Neophylax was more resistant than Ironoquia to dislodgment from cobbles and simulated bedrock, largely because of differences in body morphology and mass. These differences also partially explain why stony macrohabitats in the stream provided better flow refugia for Neophylax than for Ironoquia. Ironoquia, but not Neophylax, laid silk draglines, which helped prevent flow-induced dislodgment in low to moderate current speeds (less than or equal to 0.4 m/s). Our study demonstrates how spatial attributes, scales, and species traits interact to determine or mediate flood effects on these caddisflies.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,23,3,,480,493,,10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0480:SASAST>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000224285100006

These aquatic habitats show considerable ecological diversity, and allopatric populations have evolved differences in morphology and behavior. Here we investigated whether the divergence of pupfish populations in Death Valley might be associated with changes in arginine vasotocin (AVT). We used immunocytochemistry to compare the expression of AVT in the brain of Amargosa pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis) from two Death Valley populations: (1) the Amargosa River-a highly variable desert stream containing the Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae subspecies, and (2) Big Spring-a comparatively stable springhead and outflow inhabited by Cyprinodon nevadensis mionectes. These particular populations have been isolated from each other for only 400-4000 years. In both populations AVT-immunoreactive somata localized to parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the preoptic area, with AVT-immunoreactive fibers extending ventrolaterally to innervate the pituitary. We found that both parvocellular and magnocellular AVT-immunoreactive neurons were significantly larger in males and females from the Amargosa River population than in same sex pupfish from Big Spring. Our findings suggest that the divergent ecological conditions of these two habitats have brought about changes in AVT pathways in the brain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Fish,2004,"Lema, SC; Nevitt, GA",Exogenous vasotocin alters aggression during agonistic exchanges in male Amargosa River pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae),"Pupfishes in the Death Valley region have rapidly differentiated in social behaviors since their isolation in a series of desert streams, springs, and marshes less than 20,000 years ago. These habitats can show dramatic fluctuations in ecological conditions, and pupfish must cope with the changes by plastic physiological and behavioral responses. Recently, we showed differences among some Death Valley populations in brain expression of arginine vasotocin (AVT). As AVT regulates both hydromineral balance and social behaviors in other taxa, these population differences may indicate adaptive changes in osmoregulatory and/or behavioral processes. To test whether AVT is relevant for behavioral shifts in these fish, here we examined bow manipulations to the AVT system affect agonistic and reproductive behaviors in Amargosa River pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae), We administered exogenous AVT (0.1, 1, and 10 mug/g body weight) and an AVP V(1) receptor antagonist (Manning compound, 2.5 mug/g body weight) intraperitoneally to males in mixed-sex groups in the laboratory. We found that AVT reduced the initiation of aggressive social interactions with other pupfish but had no effect on courtship. The effects of AVT were confirmed in males in the wild where AVT (1 mug/g body weight) reduced the aggressive initiation of social interactions and decreased aggressive responses to the behavior of other males. Combined, these results show that AVT can modulate agonistic behaviors in male pupfish and support the idea that variation in AVT activity may underlie differences in aggression among Death Valley populations.

We used terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RLFP, a molecular genetic technique) to test for seasonal and spatial differences in bacterial composition in these same streams. We then related the above parameters, in conjunction with periphyton biomass and hyporheic respiration, to whole stream estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in a glacial and nonglacial stream, representing environmental extremes, in one of the catchments. The percentage of organic matter of sediments was 4-14% (0.01-0.04 g AFDM ml sediment(-1)), and counts of bacteria cells per millimeter of sediment averaged 2 X 10(6)-4 X 10(6). Bacteria counts correlated with sediment AFDM only for streams in the catchment with highest sediment AFDM levels. Bacteria composition (based on the presence and absence of terminal restriction fragments from T-RFLP analysis) changed seasonally in the different streams and differed between glacial and groundwater-fed streams. In the one catchment, hyporheic respiration averaged 0.0004 and 0.0003 g O-2 h(-1) kg sediment(-1) and was positively correlated with AFDM (r(2) = 0.23). Ecosystem metabolism displayed a strong seasonality, with GPP averaging 4.5 and 8.4 and ER averaging 5.4 and 9.9 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for the two sites, respectively, thus indicating a predominance of heterotrophy (P: R < 1) in these high-elevation, open-canopied systems.

Biogeochemistry,2004,"Marti, E; Aumatell, J; Gode, L; Poch, M; Sabater, F",Nutrient retention efficiency in streams receiving inputs from wastewater treatment plants,"We tested the effect of nutrient inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on stream nutrient retention efficiency by examining the longitudinal patterns of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations downstream of WWTP effluents in 15 streams throughout Catalonia (Spain). We hypothesized that large nutrient loadings would saturate stream communities, lowering nutrient retention efficiency (i.e., nutrient retention relative to nutrient flux) relative to less polluted streams. Longitudinal variation in ambient nutrient concentration reflected the net result of physical, chemical, or biological uptake and release processes. Therefore, gradual increases in nutrient concentration indicate that the stream acts as a net source of nutrients to downstream environments, whereas gradual declines indicate that the stream acts as a net sink. In those streams where gradual declines in nutrient concentration were observed, we calculated the nutrient uptake length as an indicator of the stream nutrient retention efficiency. No significant decline was found in dilution-corrected concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate in 40 and 45% of streams, respectively. In the remaining streams, uptake length (estimated based on the decline of nutrient concentrations at ambient levels) ranged from 0.14 to 29 km (DIN), and from 0.14 to 14 kin (phosphate). Overall, these values are longer (lower retention efficiency) than those from nonpolluted streams of similar size, supporting our hypothesis, and suggest that high nutrient loads affect fluvial ecosystem function. This study demonstrates that the efficiency of stream ecosystems to remove nutrients has limitations because it can be significantly altered by the quantity and quality of the receiving water.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,33,1,,285,293,,,,,,,,0047-2425,,WOS:000188497100031

Many of the streams have abundant perennial mats of filamentous cyanobacteria. The algal mats grow during streamflow in the austral summer and are in a dormant freeze-dried state during the rest of the year. NO3 and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were lower in streams with abundant algal mats than in streams with sparse algal mats. NO3 and SRP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone of a stream with abundant algal mats than in the stream itself. An experimental injection of LiCl, NaNO3, and K3PO4 was conducted in Green Creek, which has abundant algal mats. Substantial hyporheic exchange occurred. The NO3 and PO4 concentrations at 50 m below the injection were 55 muM and 18 muM, respectively, during the experiment. NO3 and PO4 concentrations were below the detection limit of 1 to 2 muM at a site 497 m below the injection during the Cl tracer arrival, indicating a high capacity for nutrient uptake by algal communities. NO2 and NH4 were present at sites 226 and 327 m below the injection, indicating that, in addition to denitrification and algal uptake, dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NO2 and NH4 may be a NO3 sink during transport. Transport modelling with nutrient uptake represented as a 1(st)-order process yielded reach-scale parameters of 4.3 x 10(-5) to 3.9 x 10(-4)/s and 1.4 x 10(-4) to 3.8 x 10(-1)/s for uptake of NO3 and PO4, respectively. The best match with the observed data was a model in which PO4 uptake occurred only in the main channel and NO3 uptake occurred in the main channel and in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic NO3 uptake was 7 to 16% of the total uptake for the different stream reaches. These results demonstrate that nutrient flux to the lakes is controlled by hyporheic exchange and nutrient uptake by algal mats in dry valley streams. Streams without algal mats contribute more nutrients to the lakes than streams with algal mats.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,23,2,,171,188,,10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0171:INAPDO>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000221974000002

For the particular situation of Mediterranean streams in Southern Europe, high changes in water level, with unpredicting flood events, represent an important factor determining the structure and function of Mediterranean streams. This variability, inducing accentuated changes in the macroinvertebrate community, tends to influence the assessment methodologies. A set of metrics commonly used in Europe to assess organic degradation (Shannon-Wiener index, evenness, richness, BBI, IBE, BMWP', ASPT', DSFI, EPT, number of Trichoptera families, percentage of Gasteropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera) and a multimetric index (IM9) developed to assess organic degradation in southern siliceous Portuguese basins were tested to evaluate quality at two contrasting sites (one unimpaired and another impaired by an identified point source of pollution). The multimetric index (IM9) composed by: ASPT' (average score per taxon); GOLD (one minus percentage of Gasteropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera); and TRICF (number of Trichoptera families), was the most suitable assessment methodology. IM9 presented a quite stable temporal pattern from February in late winter until June in early summer, even under the effect of episodic floods. A stepwise regression showed that most of tested metrics were significantly related to environmental variables (soluble reactive phosphorous, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved oxygen). Only richness, IBE and BMWP' were not significantly influenced by environmental variables.

System A uses fixed categories of three parameters to classify rivers: three altitude ranges, four basin size ranges, and three geological categories. In the other hand, System B proposes to establish river types analyzing different factors considered as obligatory and optional. Here, we tested Systems A and B in the Catalan River Basin District (NE Spain).The application of System A results in 26 river types: 8 in the Pyrenees and 18 in the Iberic-Macaronesian ecoregions. This number would require the establishment of a complex management system and control of the ecological status in a relatively small river basin district. We propose a multivariant system to synthesize the environmental descriptors and to define river types using System B. We use five hydrological, seven morphological, five geological, and two climatic variables to discriminate among river types. This method results in fewer river type categaries than System A but is expected to achieve the same degree of differentiation because of the large number of descriptors considered. Two levels are defined in our classification method using System B. Five ""river types,"" defined at large scale (1:1,000,000), are mainly discriminated by annual runoff coefficient, air temperature, and discharge. This level is useful and could facilitate comparisons of results among European river basin districts, The second level defines 10 ""subtypes of river management,"" mainly discriminated by geology in the basin and flow regime, This level is more adequate at local scale (1:250,000) and provides a useful tool for management purposes in relatively small and heterogeneous river basin districts.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,34,5,,711,729,,10.1007/s00267-003-0098-y,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:000226582800011

Specific conductance, pool volume, and turbidity were significant predictors of species presence in isolated pools. The presence of the Red River pupfish Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis increased with specific conductance and decreased with turbidity. The presence of the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, red shiner Cyprinella lutrensis, plains minnow Hybognathus placitus, smalleye shiner Notropis buccula, and sharpnose shiner N. oxyrhynchus decreased as specific conductance increased and as volume and turbidity decreased. Pools sampled through time showed progressive, predictable changes in environmental conditions. As pools evaporated, specific conductance increased and volume and turbidity decreased. Decreases in cyprinid presence and abundance occurred concurrently with increases in specific conductance and decreases in volume; however, cyprinodontid presence remained constant and abundance increased. These results demonstrate that changes in fish assemblage structure in drying pools are predictable.

The study area consisted of two ephemeral streams: Burger Draw and Sue Draw. These streams are tributaries to the perennial Powder River. Samples were collected bimonthly from three CBM discharge points and seven channel locations in Burger Draw and Sue Draw. Samples were also collected bimonthly from the Powder River above and below the confluence of Burger Draw. Before sample collection, the pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured in the field. Samples were transported to the laboratory and analyzed for alkalinity, major cations, and anions. From the measurement of sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), practical sodium adsorption ratio (SARp) and true sodium adsorption ratio (SARt) were calculated. Results suggest pH and EC of CBM discharge water was 7.1 and 4.3 dS/m, respectively. The CBM discharge water consisted of higher concentrations of sodium and alkalinity compared to other components. The pH of CBM discharge water increased significantly (p = 0.000) in the downstream channel of Burger Draw from 7.1 to 8.84 before it joined with the Powder River. Dissolved calcium concentration of CBM discharge water decreased significantly (p = 0.000) in the downstream channel water. Subsequently, SARp increased approximately from 24 to 29. The SARt also increased significantly (p = 0.001) in the downstream channel water. For instance, SARt of CBM discharge water increased from 32.93 to 45.5 downstream channels after the confluence of Sue Draw with the Burger Draw. The only significant difference in water chemistry above and below the confluence of Burger Draw with the Powder River was pH, which increased from 8.36 to 8.52. The significant increase in SAR values of CBM discharge water in Burger Draw and Sue Draw tributaries suggest a careful monitoring of salinity and sodicity is needed if CBM discharge water is used for irrigation in semi-arid environments.

Results of soil samples reported concentrations between 19-17 384 mg kg(-1) As, 15-7200 mg kg(-1) Cu, 31-3450 mg kg(-1) Pb and 26-6270 mg kg(-1) Zn, meanwhile, the concentrations in dry stream sediment samples were found to vary between 29-28 600 mg kg(-1) As, 50-2160 mg kg(-1) Pb, 71-2190 mg kg(-1) Cu, and 98-5940 mg kg(-1) Zn. The maximum arsenic concentration in pluvial water storage ponds (265 mug L-1), near the main potential sources of pollution, exceed by 5 times the Mexican drinking water quality guideline (50 mug L-1). The arsenic concentrations in water storage ponds and stream sediments decrease as distance from the potential sources increase. A special case is the 'Cerrito Blanco' area located 5 km east of Matehuala, where the highest arsenic concentration in water was found (>5900 mug L-1), exceeding by 100 times the established guideline, thus representing a severe health risk. The results suggest that arsenic and heavy metal dispersion from their pollution sources (historical and active tailings impoundments, waste rock dumps and historical slag piles), is mainly associated in this site with: (1) fluvial transportation of mine waste through streams that cross the area in W-E direction; and (2) aeolian transportation of mineral particles in SW-NE direction.

Assessment,2004,"Reneau, SL; Drakos, PG; Katzman, D; Malmon, DV; McDonald, EV; Ryti, RT",Geomorphic controls on contaminant distribution along an ephemeral stream,"Sediment-borne contamination in a watershed can be highly variable as a result of fluvial processes operating over a range of time scales. This study presents a detailed analysis of the distribution of one contaminant along an ephemeral stream after 55 years of sediment transport, deposition, and exchange by flash floods. Wastewater containing plutonium was discharged into the Pueblo Canyon watershed from 1945 until 1964, and plutonium concentrations in fluvial deposits vary over five orders of magnitude. These variations can be attributed to three primary factors: time since contaminant releases, particle-size sorting, and mixing of sediment from different sources. The highest concentrations occur in fine-grained sediment deposits near the source that date to the period of effluent releases, and concentrations are lower in younger deposits, in coarser-grained deposits, and in deposits farther downstream. The spatial distribution of plutonium is strongly affected by longitudinal variations in the size of sediment deposits of different age. A major aggradation-degradation cycle in the lower canyon overlapped with the period of active effluent releases, and a significant portion of the total plutonium inventory is contained within large coarse-grained deposits below fill terraces that post-date 1945. The spatial pattern of contamination is thus determined by the specific geomorphic history of the watershed, in addition to processes of mixing and sorting during transport that occur in all fluvial systems.

Invertebrate,2004,"Robinson, CT; Tockner, K; Burgherr, P",Drift benthos relationships in the seasonal colonization dynamics of alpine streams,"We examined seasonal patterns in macroinvertebrate benthic abundance and drift in relation to their colonization dynamics in five contrasting streams. The streams, within an alpine glacial flood plain, differed over an annual cycle in flow permanence and surface hydrologic connectivity with the main floodplain channel. Study streams included an upper and lower main channel, a side-channel seasonally connected upstream to the main channel, and an intermittent side-slope tributary and permanent springbrook having no upstream surface connection to the main channel. Flow in the main and side-channels was influenced seasonally by upstream glaciers, whereas the tributary and springbrook had no direct glacial input. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed markedly among streams. Density, biomass, and taxonomic richness typically were lowest in the upper main channel and highest in the springbrook. Seasonal changes in assemblage composition were more pronounced in the main and side-channels than in the tributary and springbrook. In the upper main channel, larvae colonizing cages filled with natural substrata reflected benthic assemblage structure regardless of season and colonizing taxa exhibited a high propensity to drift. In contrast, larval colonists differed significantly from benthic assemblages in the tributary and springbrook, and colonists were mostly from drift. The lower main and side-channels displayed high seasonality in colonization dynamics, being related to their hydrologic connectivity to other streams that may have provided larval colonists. Benthos to drift abundance ratios suggested that the upper main channel represented a relatively closed system with little interaction among other streams in the flood plain, whereas the springbrook and tributary seasonally subsidized larval colonists to downstream channels.",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,160,4,,447,470,,10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0160-0447,,,,,,0003-9136,,WOS:000223721000002

Rock and sand colonization and biofilm formation was intensively studied for 44 d at two stream reaches: control and experimental (continuous addition of phosphate, ammonia, and nitrate). Structural (C, N, and polysaccharide content and bacterial and chlorophyll density) and metabolic biofilm parameters (beta-glucosidase, peptidase, and phosphatase enzyme activities) were analyzed throughout the colonization process. The epilithic biofilm (grown on rocks) had a higher peptidase activity at the impacted reach, together with a higher algal and bacterial biomass. The positive relationship between the peptidase activity per cell and the N content of the epilithic biofilm suggested that heterotrophic utilization of proteinaceous compounds from within the biofilm was occurring. In contrast, nutrient addition caused the epipsammic biofilm (grown on sand) to exhibit lower beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activities, without a significant increase in bacterial and algal biomass. The differential response to nutrient addition was related to different structural characteristics within each biofilm. The epipsammic biofilm had a constant and high C:N ratio (22.7) throughout the colonization. The epilithic biofilm had a higher C:N ratio at the beginning of the colonization (43.2) and evolved toward a more complex structure (high polysaccharide content and low C:N ratio) during later stages. The epipsammic biofilm was a site for the accumulation and degradation of organic matter: polysaccharides and organic phosphorus compounds had higher degradation activities.",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,49,5,,1713,1721,,,,,,,,0024-3590,,WOS:000224979900022

We examined macroinvertebrate assemblages of temporary and permanent alpine streams in the Swiss Alps over a seasonal cycle (spring through autumn). Temporary streams contained fewer taxa and lower zoobenthos abundances than permanent streams, although within stream type variability was high. Temporary streams that dried in early summer were dominated by Chironomidae and Oligochaeta, whereas those that dried later in summer were dominated only by Chironomidae. Permanent streams were dominated by Chironomidae and Turbellaria or Chironomidae and EPT taxa. No seasonal increase in taxon richness was evident in either stream type, but taxa were replaced by other taxa over time. Chironomid assemblages had higher richness in permanent streams. and Orthocladiinae were rare in temporary streams. The life cycle of the common simuliid Prosimulium latimucro was more synchronous. and its development faster, ill temporary than permanent sites. High temperatures and low precipitation caused drought conditions in summer 2003. In one permanent stream, the assemblage was dominated by chironomids in 2002 (a normal weather year), while the turbellarian Crenobia alpina accounted for similar to 50 % of the assemblage in 2003.

These erosion controls must minimize risks to the public and structures. Water and sediment loads commonly originate from off-site sources and many of the traditional reactionary measures (installing rip-rap or some other form of bed or bank armor) simply transfer or delay the problem.

This paper describes the likely effects of metal pollution on the macroinvertebrate community in the first 15 km of the river adjacent to the mine, 2 years after the spill. The contents of Zn, Cu, Pb, As, Cd, Tl, and Sb in water, sediment, and in the caddisfly Hydropsyche were analysed, together with some physico-chemical parameters. From the results of physico-chemical and community parameters, the studied area was divided into three sections: the first section contained upstream control stations, not affected by current mining activities, and with a diverse macroinvertebrate community structure (mean number of families = 19); the second section, close to the mine, was severely polluted, with more than 50 mg l(-1) of Zn or 1.6 mg l(-1) of Cu in water, a pH of nearly 4, and a very diminished macroinvertebrate community (three families); in the last section, 6-15 km downstream from the mine, the water quality improved, metal concentrations decreased, PH reached neutrality and the macroinvertebrate community comprised eight families. We also determined metal concentrations in the larvae of Hydropsyche and found increases of 3- to 35-fold (for Cu and Cd, respectively) compared to control sites. As far as we are aware, these values are the highest concentrations so far detected in this caddisfly anywhere in the world. Different patterns of metal and PH tolerance were identified in macroinvertebrates. Most of the species were intolerant to present pollution levels and were only present in control sites. Others were tolerant to metal pollution but not to low PH and were present in the main river downstream of the mine, while a very few species managed to live in the most polluted section, with very low PH and high metal concentrations.

The Tafna river (Algeria) collects heavily polluted wastewater from the town of Maghnia and from several factories. Organic pollution comes from domestic sewage and from food industries. Ore treatment industries discharge very acidic wastewater. Temperature, pH, conductivity, chloride, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and nitrogen compounds have been surveyed between 1996 and 2001, before and after the construction of the dam. The change in each parameter is compared between sites located upstream and downstream from the dam.The spatio-temporal evolution of the organic pollution indicators was highlighted by ANOVA and principal component analysis. By enhancing sedimentation of the organic matter, the reservoir makes possible a significant decline in the BOD downstream of the dam, but increases NH4 concentration at the downstream sites. The pollution is diluted during high flows and dam releases. Conversely, during low flow periods, mineralization of organic matter is higher in the lower Tafna.

Aerial photographs were used to estimate post fire live canopy cover within streamside and upland zones on the southeast and southwest-facing slopes of 33 watersheds. Live canopy cover did not differ significantly between streamside and upland zones in the watersheds. Fire severity data obtained from aerial photographs were highly correlated with fire severity data obtained in the field in six of the watersheds, confirming that aerial photograph estimates of live canopy cover reflected actual conditions on the ground. While previous studies indicate that fire severity may be lower along perennial streams, the results of this study suggest that fire severity in intense events may be similar between intermittent stream channels and adjacent upland areas. At the landscape scale, differences in fire severity along streams of different sizes may influence the mosaic of post fire vegetation and contribute to overall structural diversity in forests of mountainous landscapes.

Between these two extreme assumptions, rivers could be grouped according to the available measurements. This is a clustering problem, and the current study attempts to find an answer to the posed question using the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), a probabilistic alternative to the Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

Wildfires are often followed by severe, sediment-laden floods in burned catchments. In this study, we documented resistance and resilience of stream insect communities to repeated postfire flash floods in a 'burned stream'. We employed a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, where communities in comparable reaches of a burned stream and a reference stream were sampled from 2 years before, to 6 years after, a crown wildfire in north-central New Mexico.2. The first 100-year flood following the 1996 Dome wildfire reduced total insect density and taxon richness to near zero in the burned stream. Despite showing low resistance, density returned rapidly to prefire levels because of colonisation by simuliids, chironomids and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus. In general, taxa that were generalist feeders (collectors) with strong larval dispersal dominated communities in early postfire years with repeated, moderate flash floods.3. Taxon richness and community composition were less resilient to postfire hydrologic disturbances. Taxon richness did not recover until floods dampened 4 years after the fire. Despite hydrologic recovery, composition in the burned stream still differed from prefire and reference stream compositions after 6 years postfire. A unique assemblage, dominated by taxa with strong larval or adult dispersal, was established after flash floods abated. Specialist feeders (shredders and grazers) that were common in prefire years were reduced or absent in the postfire assemblage.4. Community succession in the burned stream was explained by the interaction between species traits, geographic barriers to colonisation and hydrologic conditions after the fire. Comparable changes in insect density, taxon richness, community composition and trait representation were not found in the reference stream, providing strong evidence that repeated postfire flash floods shaped community responses in the burned stream.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,49,10,,1243,1259,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01261.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000223906000001

With BVET, independent samples are drawn from natural habitat units in the stream rather than sampling ""representative reaches."" This sampling protocol provides an alternative to traditional reach-level surveys, which are criticized for their lack of accuracy in estimating abundance at larger scales. BVET methodologies have been adopted and used by numerous government agencies for monitoring stream biota. Many of the assumptions of BVET methods, however, cannot be met in streams where they are being implemented because of unsuitable conditions for BVET surveys. Lack of bed control structures, variability in flow regimes, and lack of consistency among observers create difficulties in assessing habitat using BVET methods. BVET methods also are used to assess assemblage structure in streams although that was not the application for which they were originally designed. Representative reach approaches also have problems, as they often do not accurately reflect conditions present throughout the stream.

Assessment,2004,"Xu, JX",A study of anthropogenic seasonal rivers in China,"Natural rivers may be classified into two flow durations, perennial and seasonal. However, due to strong human activities, some perennial rivers in north China have been changed into seasonal rivers, among which the most striking examples are the lower Yellow River, the lower Yongdinghe River and the lower Hutuohe River in North China Plain. These rivers can be regarded as a new category of rivers, and termed anthropogenic seasonal river (ASR) in the present study. The transformation from perennial rivers to ASRs occurs under the influence of both natural factors and human activities. In the zones with some specific combination of environmental settings, the transformation from perennial to ASRs is most likely to occur. These zones can be regarded as sensitive or susceptible zones of ASRs. In the present study, three sensitive zones of ASRs have been identified, i.e., the transitional zone from and to semiarid climates, the zone of ""superelevated river"" (i.e., a river whose bed is higher than the floodplain behind the artificial levees) development, and the zone with unbalanced land-water coupling. To a great degree, the formation of ASRs in these susceptible zones is the result of the excessive water diversion by human beings for irrigation and other water demands during low-water seasons. This study shows that the major anthropogenic seasonal rivers in China such as the lower Yellow River and Haihe River, and some of their tributaries are all located in these susceptible zones.

Macroinvertebrate community structure and stream ecosystem metabolism were measured during seasonal summer droughts in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Ecosystem metabolism was profoundly affected by stream intermittency. Organic matter that accumulated during the dry period enhanced ecosystem respiration during the postdrought recovery. Highest biotic diversity was found at low water levels as the stream dried and contracted. Macroinvertebrate community response to drying was stepped and apparently defined by thresholds of transition from drying to cessation of flow and from the dry phase to restoration of flow. Environmental conditions changed markedly with cessation of flow, causing large changes in community structure during 2001 and 2003 (dry years). Drying caused an increase in macroinvertebrate density that peaked in isolated pools soon after flow ceased, but then decreased rapidly because of the physicochemical changes associated with fragmentation of the watercourse. The macroinvertebrate community at the end of the summer dry phase (when flow resumed) differed from the community that had been present before drying began. Differences in community structure during the summer dry period were not as marked in 2002 (a wet year) as in 2001/2003. The influence of drought on the macroinvertebrate community differed across substrata. Drying led to significant changes in density on cobbles and leaves, but not on sand.

Quantitative random samples were taken every 2-3 weeks during an annual surficial flow period, from November 2000 to mid-July 2001. Instars of field-collected larvae were determined by measurements of head width and pronotum length, and the sex of all pupae was determined to study sexual dimorphism and sex ratio.3. Stage-frequency histograms suggested a trivoltine population, with an average cohort time of 4 months. Larval development was asynchronous, with continuous growth and overlapping generations. Recruitment peaks were identified in mid-November, early March and late June, indicative of winter, spring and summer generations. On average, females were larger than males and the mean sex ratio was 2 : 3 (females : males). Population densities and biomasses derived from the field data were used to calculate production and turnover rate.4. Annual production of A. quadratus in the torrent Gorg Blau (4.80 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1)) was the highest ever reported for the genus, being comparable with that estimated for some insects with rapid development and multiple cohorts.5. Estimates of production of A. quadratus were combined with foregut content analysis to estimate the fraction of total production derived from the principal food sources: algae and organic detritus. Algae supported a major proportion of the production of this grazer.6.

Spatial variation in fish-assemblage structure and the abundance of five species in disconnected waterholes early in the dry season (April 2001) were related to the extent of floodplain inundation 14 months previously, and to the interconnectedness of waterholes and waterhole habitat structure. As the dry season progressed, waterhole volumes decreased owing to evaporative water loss and structural habitat elements (anabranches, bars, boulders) became exposed. Marked changes in fish assemblage structure between the early (April) and late (September) dry season were related to habitat loss but not to water chemistry. Interactions between flow and habitat across a nested hierarchy of spatial scales (the floodplain, the waterhole and habitat patches within waterholes) were crucial to the persistence of fish assemblages through the 2001 dry season.

This is the first study on the life cycle, growth and production of Sigara selecta, a Palearctic corixid species typical of brackish and saline waters, at the warmest limit of its European distributional range. The study combines field and laboratory approaches.2. The S. selecta population studied was multivoltine, producing four asynchronous cohorts from early spring to December and overwintering in the adult state. Development time from egg to first adult ranged from 2 to 3 months. A minimum temperature threshold of 10 degrees C and diel amplitude of >= 10 degrees C were observed for reproduction and oviposition.3. Maximum density and biomass were reached in mid spring and early autumn. The sex ratio was unbalanced, females dominating during most of the year, except in spring, when the sex ratio was balanced or dominated by males during the first adult emergence.4. Laboratory rearing experiments at constant temperatures (18, 22 and 26 degrees C) pointed to a significant effect of temperature on egg development and nymphal growth. In the range of temperatures tested, both egg and nymphal instar duration decreased with increasing temperature. Mean nymphal development time varied from 43 days at 26 degrees C to 71 days at 18 degrees C, with a mean of 57 days. Survivorship was independent of temperature.5. A reduction in nymphal and adult length was observed with increasing temperature.6. Growth rates decreased with increasing body mass and increased as temperature increased. The first nymphal instar had the highest length increments and growth rates in all temperature treatments.7. Satisfactory agreement was found between the field and laboratory degree-days required for complete development from egg to first adult. At constant and variable thermal regimes, degree-days decreased with increasing temperature.8. Rate of growth in the field could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from a simple model obtained as a function of body mass. The model explained 67% of the variability in growth rates.9. Annual production and production/biomass ratio (P/B) of S. selecta estimated by the Instantaneous Growth method were 1.28 g m(-2) year(-1) and 13.71, respectively. Spring and autumn cohorts contributed 32% and 54%, respectively, of total annual production. Maximum production corresponded to intermediate temperature periods, although summer production may have been underestimated because of the longer sampling interval relative to cohort interval production.

The influence of flow on streamwater concentrations and seasonal differences in quality and origin of dissolved organic matter, inferred from dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen ratios (DOC:DON ratios), were examined. During baseflow conditions, nitrate and ammonium had opposite behaviour, probably controlled by biological processes such as vegetation uptake and mineralization activity. DON concentrations did not have a seasonal trend. During storms, nitrate and DON increased by several times but discharge was not a good predictor of nutrient concentrations. DOC:DON ratios in streamwater were around 26, except during the months following drought when DOC:DON ratios ranged between 42 and 20 during baseflow and stormflow conditions, respectively. Annual N export during 2000-2001 was 70 kg km(-1) year(-1), of which 75% was delivered during stormflow.

Invertebrate,2005,"Bonada, N; Zamora-Munoz, C; Rieradevall, M; Prat, N",Ecological and historical filters constraining spatial caddisfly distribution in Mediterranean rivers,"1. Contemporary species distributions are determined by a mixture of ecological and historical filters acting on several spatial and temporal scales. Mediterranean climate areas are one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with a high level of endemicity, which is linked to complex ecological and historical factors.2. This paper explores the ecological and historical factors constraining the distribution of caddisfly species on a large regional scale. A total of 69 taxa were collected from 140 sampling sites in 10 Iberian Mediterranean river basins. Approximately 74% of taxa can be considered rare, with the southern basins (the Baetic-Riffian region) having greater endemicity. The greatest richness, involving a mixture of northern and southern species, was found in the transitional area between the Baetic-Riffian region and the Hesperic Massif.3. The historical processes occurring during the Tertiary (i.e. the junction of the Eurasian and African plates) explained 3.1% of species distribution, whereas ecological factors accounted for 20.7%. Only 0.3% was explained by the interaction of history and ecology. A set of multi-scale ecological variables (i.e. basin, reach and bedform characteristics) defined five river types with specific caddisfly assemblages. The commonest caddisfly species accounted for the regional distribution pattern, while rare taxa contributed to the explanation of subtle patterns not shown by common species.4. Despite the importance of historical factors for biogeography and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. This may be explained by the length of time since the historical process we are considering, the high dispersion and colonisation capacity of many caddisfly species, and the strong environmental gradient in the area. Because of the historical and environmental complexity of Mediterranean areas, rare taxa should be included in ecological studies so that the singularity of these ecosystems is not missed.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,50,5,,781,797,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01357.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000228690300005
Biogeochemistry,2005,"Butturini, A; Bernal, S; Sabater, F",Modeling storm events to investigate the influence of the stream-catchment interface zone on stream biogeochemistry,"We formulate a new mixing model to explore hydrological and chemical conditions under which the interface between the stream and catchment interface (SCI) influences the release of reactive solutes into stream water during storms. Physically, the SCI corresponds to the hyporheic/riparian sediments. In the new model this interface is coupled through a bidirectional water exchange to the conventional two components mixing model. Simulations show that the influence of the SCI on stream solute dynamics during storms is detectable when the runoff event is dominated by the infiltrated groundwater component that flows through the SCI before entering the stream and when the flux of solutes released from SCI sediments is similar to, or higher than, the solute flux carried by the groundwater. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate data from two small Mediterranean streams obtained during storms are compared to results from simulations using the new model to discern the circumstances under which the SCI is likely to control the dynamics of reactive solutes in streams. The simulations and the comparisons with empirical data suggest that the new mixing model may be especially appropriate for streams in which the periodic, or persistent, abrupt changes in the level of riparian groundwater exert hydrologic control on flux of biologically reactive fluxes between the riparian/hyporheic compartment and the stream water.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,41,8,,,,W08418,10.1029/2004WR003842,,,,,,0043-1397,,WOS:000231573900003
Biogeochemistry,2005,"Cavalcanti, GG; Lockaby, BG",Effects of sediment deposition on fine root dynamics in riparian forests,"One of the most important functions of riparian zones is their ability to improve water quality by trapping sediment leaving agricultural fields and other disturbed areas. However, few data exist quantifying the impacts of sediment deposition from anthropogenic disturbance on belowground processes within these ecosystems. This study was conducted at Ft. Benning, GA, where disturbance caused by military training has generated a range of sedimentation levels in riparian forests near ephemeral streams. Nine ephemeral streams, exhibiting different levels of sediment deposition, were selected for study. Two paired treatment plots (upper and lower) were established along each catchment to represent potentially disturbed and control conditions, respectively. On highly and moderately disturbed catchments, upper plots had received varying rates of sediment from erosion along unpaved roads. Biomass, turnover, productivity, and nutrient contents of fine roots were compared within and across catchments. Temporal fluctuations in biomass of live and dead fine roots were observed for both treatments in the three disturbance categories, except for upper plots of highly disturbed catchments, where biomass remained fairly low and constant throughout the study. Fine root productivity declined sharply with sediment rates as low as 0.3 cm yr(-1). Nutrient contents of live and dead fine roots followed a similar trend to that of root biomass. These data suggest that fine root dynamics may be affected by sediment deposition rates commonly occurring in some wetland forests, and the water filtration function performed by these ecosystems may be at risk.",SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,69,3,,729,737,,10.2136/sssaj2004.0239,,,,,,0361-5995,,WOS:000229009800020
"Invertebrate, Biogeochemistry",2005,"Chadwick, MA; Huryn, AD",Response of stream macroinvertebrate production to atmospheric nitrogen deposition and channel drying,"We assessed the effect of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on secondary production in a first-order intermittent stream at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). BBWM is a paired-catchment experiment designed to determine the effects of N deposition on a forested ecosystem. Nitrogen as (NH4)(2)SO4 has been applied to the treatment catchment since 1989, with the adjacent catchment serving as a reference (both are drained by a first-order intermittent stream). Secondary production and detritus biomass were quantified for 2 yr. Production did not vary between streams (range = 1.7-2.3 g ash-free dry mass m(-2) yr(-1)) but was similar to35% higher for both streams in the second year. The distribution of production among functional feeding groups varied little between streams but differed among taxa. Detritus biomass was similar between streams but was similar to25% higher in the second year. The (NH4)(2)SO4 treatment had no effect on production in the treatment stream. The statistically identical level of production between streams is presumably because of similar habitat, channel drying, and trophic resources. Difference in production between years was positively related to detritus biomass. Differences in the distribution of production among taxa between streams were likely the result of contrasts in the duration of flowing water, with the treatment stream having the longer duration. Our study indicates that patterns of litter input and channel drying, rather than N deposition, control levels of secondary production in these intermittent streams by altering both resource availability and community structure. These variables apparently override the effects of N deposition in regions where nitrogen is not a limiting nutrient.",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,50,1,,228,236,,,,,,,,0024-3590,,WOS:000226406800021
Biogeochemistry,2005,"Chadwick, MA; Huryn, AD",Effects of atmospheric N deposition on coarse organic matter in a headwater stream,"Input, storage, export potential, and system-level processing of coarse organic matter were investigated in the intermittent streams that drain the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). BBWM is a paired catchment study investigating ecosystem effects of atmospheric N and S deposition. We predicted that the increased N loading to the treatment catchment would elevate input of organic matter, result in higher levels of coarse organic matter biomass, and increase litter processing rates in the treatment stream relative to the reference stream. We found that the streams draining BBWM did not have statistically different coarse organic matter input, biomass, or processing rates and we found only modest differences in export potential. System-level processing rates for maple (Acer spp.) litter were similar to rates previously quantified using litterbag methods. However, system-level processing rates for American beech (Fagus grandifolia) litter were an order of magnitude faster than rates measured with litterbags. This difference was likely due to movements of these leaves from riffle/runs and pools into debris dams, rather than differences in measurements of leaf tissue processing rates between methods. Organic matter dynamics of the intermittent streams at BBWM were similar to other forested, headwater streams. Our results indicate that the long-term N manipulation experiment at BBWM has not altered input, storage or processing of coarse organic matter in the treatment stream.

Fish,2005,"Clavero, M; Blanco-Garrido, F; Prenda, J",Fish-habitat relationships and fish conservation in small coastal streams in southern Spain,"1. Studies dealing with the fish fauna of coastal streams are scarce in the scientific literature, particularly those from Mediterranean climates. Owing to their small size, these systems suffer extreme seasonal fluctuations, following the typical Mediterranean flood-drought cycle and leading to a high risk of extinction to freshwater fish.2. This work analyses fish distribution in 14 stream stretches belonging to eight basins in the northern sector of the Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain). Fish-habitat relationships were studied through multivariate ordination techniques at two scales: basin and stretch.3. A principal components analysis clearly discriminated larger and more sinuous basins from smaller and steeper ones. This ordination was related to the non-migratory freshwater fish species richness and to the total number of fish species present in the middle reaches of each basin.4. The main sources of variation in community composition and habitat characteristics in the different stretches were related to a clear upstream-down stream gradient, along which total species richness increased.5. These small coastal basins are inhabited by two highly endangered species, Andalusian toothcarp (Aphanius baeticus) and Iberian chub (Squalius pyrenaicus), and have similar or higher overall freshwater species richness than larger adjacent basins. The near absences of flow regulation and introduced species make these streams one of the few types of Iberian aquatic system where unaltered fish-habitat relationships can be studied.

Assessment,2005,"Cluett, L",The role of flooding in morphological changes in the regulated Lower Ord River in tropical northwestern Australia,"The discharge of the Lower Ord River has been regulated since 1972 when a second dam was built on this major river system. This previously ephemeral river, punctuated by peak wet season flows, is now characterized by permanent, regulated flows all year, and complex adjustments to the downstream channel morphology are evident. Geographic Information System techniques, combined with field surveys, reveal a series of interrelated adjustments in response to recent flooding. These include sedimentation, channel narrowing and vegetation encroachment, all of which have implications for sustainable management and are issues that have been managed by flushing flows in other rivers. The largest flood events since regulation occurred some 27 years after dam construction during consecutive wet seasons. These events have prompted an examination of the potential to 'flush' the post-regulation Lower Ord channel to modify some of the channel changes that occurred in response to dam construction. A detailed geomorphic investigation of the Lower Ord river showed that that some of the features formed under low flows have been eradicated (partly or completely) by these large flood events, while others have withstood them. The modification of changes since dam construction varies according to a range of factors including reach position, extent of vegetation cover and local morphological variation. It is clear, however, that features not removed during floods may be considered quasi-permanent, and therefore are likely to play an important role in the evolution of this regulated river.

Assessment,2005,"Comoretto, L; Chiron, S",Comparing pharmaceutical and pesticide loads into a small Mediterranean river,"During 2003/2004, water samples were collected upstream and downstream of two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outlets in order to determine the contribution of urban centres to concentration of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, lipid regulators and carbamazepine) and pesticides into a Mediterranean river basin (Arc river, Aix en Provence, France). Pharmaceutical loads were compared to pesticide ones. They could be nearly regarded as important as pesticide ones at least at one sampling site. The observed pollution patterns differed from pesticides to pharmaceuticals. Pesticide pollution occurred through a high pollution peak in spring while pharmaceuticals were continuously infused into the river via WWTP effluents. Carbamazepine and bezafibrate were detected in almost all samples at concentration levels ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. The major pharmaceutical source could be ascribed to WWTP effluents and pharmaceutical concentrations increased during low flow rate conditions (summer), when municipal wastewater effluents accounted for the majority of the river water flow. Treated wastewaters contributed to a lesser extent to pesticide river water pollution. In an urbanized Mediterranean river basin, a deep understanding of water pollution by organic waste contaminants is required in order to set up an efficient programme of pollution reduction measures.

Therefore, many could be managed like small stream channels and eligible for exclusion from road decommissioning actions. Among the invertebrates inhabiting headwater streams, many have specific adaptations to low and seasonal flows.

Fish,2005,"Durham, BW; Wilde, GR",Relationship between hatch date and first-summer growth of five species of prairie-stream cyprinids,"Stream fishes often exhibit a bet-hedging multiple spawning reproductive strategy. In many species, the reproductive season lasts several months. This exposes young fishes to varying environmental conditions that may differentially affect growth. We studied the effect of hatch date on first-summer growth among members of a prairie-stream fish assemblage. The reproductive season in both years of the study was protracted, lasting from April through August. Due to intermittent stream-discharge, there were two distinct periods during which most species successfully reproduced. In general, growth rate was greater among individuals with an early hatch date than among those with a later hatch date. Multiple regression models indicated that hatch date was related to growth in all study species with one exception (red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis).

Biogeochemistry,2005,"Fisher, SG; Weiter, JR",Flowpaths as integrators of heterogeneity in streams and landscapes,"Streams are heterogeneous in both space and time. Hydrologic flowpaths along which biogeochemical processing occurs integrate different patches of the stream. Disturbance events (flood and drying) change these patches, alter connectivity, and reinforce spatial heterogeneity. Heterogeneity within patches (surface stream, hyporheic zone, sand bars, and riparian zone) is generated by the interaction of nitrogen (the limiting nutrient) in transport and organisms such as algae and bacteria. These organisms store nitrogen as they grow, alter N forms and concentrations in transport, and in some cases (e.g., denitrification) export it to the atmosphere. Changes in nitrogen in transport can be large, as are community responses to nitrogen availability, thus reinforcing spatial heterogeneity in successional time. Flowpaths connect patches as well and generate changes in recipient patches as a function of nitrogen delivery rate. This is especially evident at patch boundaries. In streams, flow is markedly linear and inexorably downstream in orientation; however, landscapes are drained by coalescing, dendritic networks that intimately connect stream channels with terrestrial flowpaths over and beneath soils. We propose that a unified theory of landscapes will require a focus on spatial linkage, a consideration of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and a blurring, of distinctions between terrestrial and aquatic elements.",Ecosystem Function in Heterogeneous Landscapes,,,,311,328,,10.1007/0-387-24091-8_15,,10th Cary Conference,"APR 29-MAY 01, 2003",USDA Forest Serv; US EPA; AW Mellon Fdn,"Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY",,0-387-24089-6,WOS:000235132700015

We developed a harshness index that quantifies ecologically pertinent spatial and temporal characteristics of prairie intermittent streams that may limit or reduce diversity and abundance to predict benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics. The index incorporates 11 variables that describe the hydrological regime (e.g. average flow, flow variability, drying and flooding) and distance to perennial surface water. We started with 27 variables, but removed 16 that did not increase the predictive value of the index. The relationships among index values and annual mean macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics (taxonomic richness, diversity, evenness and abundance) were tested over two years using seven sites that represent a range of flow permanence (recent and historical), flood magnitude ( recent and historical) and surface-water connectivity. Mean annual taxonomic richness was significantly related to the harshness index. Evenness and abundance were not related to harshness. Further analyses indicated that distance to the nearest permanent habitat was less important than annual or historical hydrological parameters, even though prior research had documented higher rates of colonisation at sites that were closer to nearest permanent habitat. Both annual factors that can alter abundance and colonisation immediately (e.g. floods, drought in each year) and historical factors (e.g. probability of drying, average length of dry period over decades) may influence assemblage characteristics. Historical factors may influence evolutionary adaptations of invertebrates and may predominate when relative disturbance rates are lower such as in years with less flooding.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,56,1,,13,23,,10.1071/MF04244,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000226762000003

The term 'rambla' defines watercourses with specific geomorphological features that make them different from all other temporary streams. Most ramblas represent extreme habitats for plants and animals that have to be adapted to high salinity and extreme hydrological fluctuations with severe dry periods and floods. Both factors shape the structure and functioning of the whole aquatic ecosystem.2. Biological communities in ramblas are diverse and rich in endemic species. Habitats of interest within the EU are extensively represented in ramblas and their associated wetlands. Ramblas also fulfil previously unrecognized functional and cultural values, such as helping to control non-point-source pollution in agricultural areas and to provide a variety of historic and educational resources. However, they are a threatened ecosystem because of the diversity of uses and derived impacts.3. To characterize and describe the diversity of ramblas in south-east Spain, an extensive survey was carried out in 2000-2001 in the province of Murcia. Based on the lithology where ramblas are located, they were grouped in three categories: ramblas of marl, limestone and metamorphic basins.4. Rambla categories differ in structural parameters, hydrology, water chemistry, biological communities and their vulnerability to a range of human impacts, thus requiring a flexible approach to their management and conservation.

Previous research indicated that streams of the southwestern USA deserts are highly retentive of N because of N limitation, high productivity, and high channel complexity (in particular, extensive transient storage associated with the hyporheic zone). Most southwestern urban streams have extensively modified channels and experience N loading from urban runoff and inputs of NO(3)(-)-contaminated groundwater. Therefore, we predicted southwestern urban streams are neither N-limited nor retentive. For some urban streams, however, restoration efforts reestablish flow in long-dry channels, create nonstructural flood-management solutions, and design riparian areas as a public recreation amenity. These human modifications may, in part, restore N retention functions if channel complexity and heterogeneity are as important to N retention efficiency as believed. We conducted experimental tracer studies using NO(3)(-), as part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX) project, and several separate nutrient-addition experiments (using slight increases in NO(3)(-) concentration), to evaluate N retention in southwestern urban streams. We present preliminary results of those experiments, comparing results to similar experiments in unaltered streams to test our predictions.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2005,"Hancock, PJ; Boulton, AJ","The effects of an environmental flow release on water quality in the hyporheic zone of the Hunter River, Australia","Environmental flow releases have been advocated as a useful rehabilitation strategy for improving river condition but assessments of their success have typically focused on surface water quality and biota. In this study, we investigated the impacts of an environmental flow release on water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentrations in surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water at upwelling and downwelling zones in three sites along the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. We hypothesised that the flow pulse would 'flush' the sediments with oxygenated water, stimulating hyporheic microbial activity and nitrification, enhancing nitrate concentrations over time. Surface and subsurface samples were collected before, 7 days after, and 49 days after an environmental flow release of 5000 MI for a period of 3 days. No lasting effects on dissolved oxygen or conductivity were evident at most sites although dissolved oxygen declined over time at the downwelling site at Bowmans Crossing. At the downwelling zones at all sites, hyporheic nitrate concentrations declined initially following the release, but then rose or leveled off by Day 49. This initial drop in concentration was attributed to flushing of nitrate from the sediments.

Assessment,2005,"Hangen-Brodersen, C; Strempel, P; Grunewald, U",Characteristics of catchments disturbed by lignite mining - case study of Schlabendorf/Seese (Germany),"In the Lower Lusatian lignite mining district, large areas have been mined and recultivated. An even larger area has been affected by groundwater lowering. The specific characteristics of catchments disturbed by lignite mining are presented for the Schlabendorf/Seese region, where a close relation between water issues and open-cast lignite mining exists. In general, this relationship starts prior to mining and persists even after the land is reclaimed.The most obvious feature of this post-mining landscape is the large number of forming post-mining lakes. A further feature is the recovery of the groundwater table. Dry streams and springs now are starting to flow again, and areas with a formerly deep groundwater table are now directly influenced by rising groundwater.The disturbance causes various acidification phenomena. The aeration of pyrite-bearing material leads to a drastic deterioration of the groundwater quality, which affects receiving streams and lakes. Thus there is the tendency for some parts of post-mining lakes to become acid. Additionally, in the marginal areas of the groundwater recovery, acidification of streams occurs, causing water quality problems in ponds and lakes located downstream.The development of each individual water body with respect to water quantity and quality depends on its specific hydrogeological and hydrological setting. The region is experiencing dynamic changes, and shows that the future development of the post-mining catchments is difficult to predict.

Fish,2005,"Hood, JM; Vanni, MJ; Flecker, AS",Nutrient recycling by two phosphorus-rich grazing catfish: the potential for phosphorus-limitation of fish growth,"In ecosystems where excretion by fish is a major flux of nutrients, the nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratio released by fish can be important in shaping patterns of algal biomass.. community composition, primary production.. and nutrient limitation. Demand for N and P as well as energy influences N/P excretion ratios and has broad implications in ecosystems where nutrient recycling by fishes is substantial. Bioenergetics and stoichiometric models predict that natural fish populations are generally energy-limited and therefore N/P recycling by fishes is relatively invariant. Yet, the potential for P limitation of growth has not been examined in herbivorous fishes, which are common in many aquatic habitats. We examined N/P excretion ratios and P demand in two P-rich herbivorous catfishes of the family Loricariidae, Ancistrus triradiatus (hereafter Ancistrus) and Chaetostonia milesi (hereafter Chaetostoma). Both fishes are common grazers in the Andean piedmont region of Venezuela where we conducted this study. Mass balance (MB) models indicate that these fishes have a high P demand. In fact, our Ancistrus P MB model predicted negative P excretion rates, indicating that Ancistrus did not consume enough P to meet its P demand for growth. Direct measurement of excretion rates showed positive, but very low P excretion rates and high N/P excretion ratios for both taxa. To obtain measured P excretion rates of Ancistrus from the MB model, gross growth efficiency must be reduced by 90%. Our results suggest that growth rates of both of these herbivorous and P-rich fish are likely P-limited. If P limitation of growth is common among herbivorous fish populations, herbivorous fishes recycle likely at high N/ P ratios and act to diminish the quality of their food.",OECOLOGIA,39,146,2,247,257,,10.1007/s00442-005-0202-5,,,,,,0029-8549,,WOS:000233875900010
Assessment,2005,"Hooke, JM; Brookes, CJ; Duane, W; Mant, JM","A simulation model of morphological, vegetation and sediment changes in ephemeral streams","A model to simulate channel changes in ephemeral river channels and to test the effects of hydrological changes due to climate change and/or land use change was developed under the auspices of the EU funded MEDALUS programme (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use). The model, CHANGISM (Channel Change GIS Simulation Model), is designed to simulate the effect of channel How events and of climate conditions on morphology, sediment and vegetation, through sequences of events and conditions, over periods of up to several decades. The modelling is based on cellular automata but with calculations for water and sediment continuity. Process rules have both deterministic and stochastic elements. An important feature of the model is that it incorporates feedback elements between each event. The main aim of the model is to indicate the likely outcomes of events and combinations of conditions. It is linked to GIS for both input and output. The modelling is based on a channel reach and state is input as GIS layers of morphology (DEM), sediment and vegetation cover and state. Other initial conditions of soil moisture, groundwater level, and overall gradient are input. Parameters for processes are read from tables and can be easily changed for successive runs of the model. The bases for decisions on process specifications are discussed in this paper. Initial tests or the operation and sensitivity of the model were made on idealized reaches. The model was then tested using data from monitored sites in SE Spain. Simulations using clear water flow worked well but initial simulations using events with sediment loads showed some tendency for excess deposition. Further tests and modifications are taking place. Overall, the model is one of the most sophisticated that simulates the interaction of flows with sediment and vegetation and the outcomes in terms of erosion, deposition, morphology, sediment cover, vegetation cover and plant survival over periods of up to 30 years for the scale of a channel reach.

In this study, the structure and functional organisation of hyporheic macroinvertebrate assemblages in pool and dry riffle bed habitats of two episodic streams were compared over summer and winter. Multivariate analyses revealed macroinvertebrate assemblages differed significantly between streams, habitats and seasons. While some seasonal differences were expected, the differences between streams were not, given the similarity and proximity of the catchments, and were due to shifts in the abundance of common taxa. Distinct differences between riffle and pool habitats were evident in both the taxonomic and functional feeding group composition of the assemblages. In particular, riffle habitats contained greater numbers of taxa and individuals and a greater proportion of filter-feeding animals compared to pool habitats. Summer samples also had greater numbers of taxa and individuals and greater proportions of collector-scrapers than winter samples. The relative abundance of functional groups was similar between streams in summer but was more variable in winter. Patterns observed in the taxonomic and functional feeding group structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages were more characteristic of perennial than episodic streams, despite the absence of regular surface flows. This could be attributed to the relatively constant hyporheic flow in these streams. We suggest that classifications of stream flow should consider hyporheic discharge (not just surface flow) as this clearly influences the stream biota.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,532,,,81,90,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000226928800008

We conducted surveys biweekly from July 2000 to July 2001 employing three sampling techniques (nocturnal line-transects, automated recording systems, and side-flap pail-traps) concurrently in each of four habitats (temporary pond, permanent pond, ephemeral stream, and permanent marsh). We detected 22 species of anurans from five families, representing 76% of the anuran species found in Taiwan. Line-transect sampling and automated recorders detected 22 and 20 species respectively, with an average of 12.3 +/- 3.2 (mean +/- SD) and 10.4 +/- 3.5 species per survey. In contrast, traps only captured 11 species, with an average of 2.1 +/- 1.5 species per survey. Automated recorders were most effective at detecting hylids, rhacophorids, and microhylids that have loud calls and/or prolonged periods of calling. Recorders were less effective at detecting ranid and bufonid species that have relatively quiet calls. Traps were good at capturing most of the ranids, species that were usually missed with automated recorders. The combination of recorders and traps was equivalent to line-transect sampling, suggesting that these two techniques are a good alternative to nocturnal line-transect sampling, a technique that is difficult to use in remote areas and/or habitats that are inaccessible at night.",HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL,15,2,,73,79,,,,,,,,0268-0130,,WOS:000231004000002
Assessment,2005,"Hughes, DA",Hydrological issues associated with the determination of environmental water requirements of ephemeral rivers,"The paper reviews the generic characteristics of ephemeral rivers compared with seasonal and perennial systems in the context of southern Africa. The difficulties of estimating the natural characteristics of ephemeral systems are discussed as well as the difficulties of estimating the impacts of water resource management strategies. Many of the problems are associated with the potentially discontinuous occurrence of flow in both time and space and the fact that static pools, as well as flowing water, may be of ecological importance. The most obvious impact of water resource developments on ephemeral rivers may be a reduction in the number and size of flow events. However, delays in the onset of flow in seasonal rivers and changes in the duration, quantity and quality of in-channel pool storage may be of equal importance. In a number of South African ephemeral channels the major impacts have been caused by the importation of water from elsewhere and a consequent reduction in streamflow variability. The paper suggests that there are a number of gaps in the understanding of the hydrology of ephemeral rivers, but perhaps more importantly, in the methods that are available to supply the type of information required by ecological specialists to be able to determine ecological water requirements under managed flow situations.

Assessment,2005,"Jenkins, KM; Boulton, AJ; Ryder, DS",A common parched future? Research and management of Australian arid-zone floodplain wetlands,"Wetlands in arid and semi-arid areas face intensifying pressure for their water resources yet harbour unique biota and ecological processes that rely on the ""boom and bust"" regime of alternating flood and drought. Recent research in Australia has revealed that models of ecosystem processes derived from northern temperate zone wetlands are often inapplicable to arid zone wetlands, confounding efforts to manage or protect these threatened habitats. We review four case studies from inland Australia that demonstrate different degrees of successful management, aiming to draw out lessons learned that will improve our sustainable use of these delicate systems. Inappropriate extrapolation across scales that ignores the inherent spatial and temporal variability of arid-zone wetlands, ""reactive"" rather than ""collaborative"" research and management, and a reluctance to adopt functional indicators to complement state variables are several common themes. We are optimistic that managers and researchers are collaborating to tackle these issues but warn that a parched future faces some wetlands where jurisdictional boundaries hamper their effective management or entrenched beliefs and community distrust of managers threaten ecologically sustainable resource use. In and areas where water is so precious, environmental allocations are costly and their long-term effects are difficult to identify against a backdrop of high inherent variability. Preservation of this variability is the key to successful management of these ""boom and bust"" systems but diametrically opposes the desire for regulated, reliable water supplies for human use. Social and institutional acceptance and change now appear to be greater barriers than limited ecological understanding to effective management of many ""parched wetlands"" in Australia.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,552,,,57,73,,10.1007/s10750-005-1505-6,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000233567800006
Assessment,2005,"Kent, R; Belitz, K; Burton, CA",Algal productivity and nitrate assimilation in an effluent dominated concrete lined stream,"This study examined algal productivity and nitrate assimilation in a 2.85 km. reach of Cucamonga Creek, California, a concrete lined channel receiving treated municipal wastewater. Stream nitrate concentrations observed at two stations indicated nearly continuous loss throughout the diel study. Nitrate loss in the reach was approximately 11 mg/L/d or 1.0 g/m(2)/d as N, most of which occurred during daylight. The peak rate of nitrate loss (1.13 mg/l/hr) occurred just prior to an afternoon total CO2 depletion. Gross primary productivity, as estimated by a model using the observed differences in dissolved oxygen between the two stations, was 228 mg/L/d, or 21 g/m(2)/d as O-2. The observed diel variations in productivity, nitrate loss, pH, dissolved oxygen, and CO2 indicate that nitrate loss was primarily due to algal assimilation. The observed levels of productivity and nitrate assimilation were exceptionally high on a mass per volume basis compared to studies on other streams; these rates occurred because of the shallow stream depth. This study suggests that concrete-lined channels can provide an important environmental service: lowering of nitrate concentrations similar to rates observed in biological treatment systems.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,41,5,,1109,1128,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03788.x,,,,,,1093-474X,,WOS:000232450800007
Assessment,2005,"Kirkby, MJ; Bracken, LJ; Shannon, J",The influence of rainfall distribution and morphological factors on runoff delivery from dryland catchments in SE Spain,"A simplified theoretical model of storm runoff has been combined with analysis of rainfall records to improve understanding of dryland runoff processes in the Guadalentin catchment of SE Spain, and in particular the decrease in runoff fraction with increasing slope length or catchment area.Estimates of storm runoff volumes can be made using a simple runoff threshold, SCS Curve Numbers, or infiltration equations. A modified Green-Ampt equation is applied here to give storm runoff estimates for conditions of constant effective rainfall intensity. This can be seen as both an improvement on estimates made using the simple runoff threshold, although with no additional parameters, and a good approximation to the SCS Curve Number family of rainfall-runoff relationships, providing an improved theoretical basis for the Curve Number approach and an explicit means of linking it to existing soils data on infiltration and surface properties. The frequency distribution of intensities is examined to determine an appropriate effective intensity in relation to slope length, with a duration long enough to allow overland flow to reach the slope base. Hydrologically Similar Surfaces (HYSS) are defined by local runoff characteristics, and the linkage to infiltration allows an explicit comparison with routing over land areas of different area, shape and topography. This provides the basis for up-scaling from at-a-point runoff to runoff from larger areas which are mapped as belonging to the same HYSS class, explicitly allowing for their different topography and size, providing an essential step in up-scaling data on fine-scale surface characteristics to the response of catchment areas. Here we focus on the ways in which catchment area or slope length influence runoff production within a given HYSS class.Characteristics which drive catchment response include (1) variations in intensity over time through a storm (2) areal variations in storm volume. For measured rainfall in the upper Guadalentin catchment, SE Spain, the first of these factors is seen to be the most important for catchments of up to 500 km(2), and a procedure is suggested for deriving effective rainfalls from recorded intensity data. The rainfall data can then be combined with a HYSS analysis of the soil/land use response, and analyses of catchment network morphology and connectivity to forecast the heterogeneous distribution of ephemeral stream runoff.

This approach has recently been tested in the Kuiseb Ephemeral River Basin with the active participation of basin stakeholders. The use of FIRM in basin management requires certain adaptations, especially in the context of ephemeral river basins. The main focus of discussion is how FIRM may be applied to basin management in ephemeral basins, highlighting a case study of the basin management process in the Kuiseb Basin in Namibia. An analysis of similarities and differences between FIRM and its application in basin management is also undertaken, illustrating how the concept is applied to basin management in ephemeral basins, particular lessons learnt and strengths of this approach. The paper concludes with recommendations on how FIRM may be established in basin management with the Kuiseb River basin providing empirical evidence of the positive potential of such an approach.

At each site water level in the alluvium and bedrock depth were recorded. The velocity of flow was estimated from the slope of the phreatic surface as well as from salt dilution experiments. A simple model has been developed based on a `closed conduit' concept, which estimates the recession of the water levels and flow rates in the alluvium, including the effects of evaporation from the sand surface as well as recharge by intermittent rainfall during the dry season.

The Njoro River, a tropical stream, was drought-stressed between late 1999 and mid 2000, providing an opportunity to sample and describe the distributional patterns of diatoms and Limnodrilus oligochaetes in the vertical sediment profile. The dispersion of Limnodrilus oligochaetes with sediment depth profile varied from quasi-random (i.e. exponent k of the negative binomial distribution > 2.0 or < 0) at the surface to strong aggregation (0 < k < 1.0) in the deeper sediments. Diatoms were heterogenous, with most species contributing less than 1% of all the diatoms collected from the riverbed. Contagious dispersion was a common feature among the diatom species. The distribution of Fragilaria ulna was largely quasi-random in all sites, with Nitzschia amphibia and Cocconeis placentula demonstrating quasi-random distribution in the Kerma vertical sediment profile.

It frequently damages the brushwood and indigenous earthen structures, locally known as agims and musghas, making (re)construction and maintenance, and ""fair"" water distribution, key elements for the system's ""sustainability"".For the past 10 decades, the Wadi Laba farmers have used a number of indigenous water management practices to cope with the (re)construction and maintenance requirements and the need to distribute the floodwater ""fairly"" within and between the upstream and downstream fields. They have introduced the ""full farmers' participation"" principle, which obliges each farmer to participate in the (re)construction and maintenance of any damaged structure, regardless of whether or not that structure affects the delivery of water to his/her field. To achieve ""fair"" water distribution, they have formulated and implemented rules, which among other things, give the tail-end farmers absolute priority water rights to large manageable floods and restrict the rights of the head-end farmers to small floods. These efforts have, however, not been sufficient to enable the farmers to meet their annual food and fodder needs. Hence, as a supplementary livelihood strategy, they have seasonally migrated to the highlands in search of a grazing area for their livestock, and to cultivate their small (less than a hectare) rainfed fields. Nonetheless, this migration coincides with the flood season, making most (re)construction and maintenance, and water distribution activities, more difficult to carry out. To minimize the problem, the farmers have established ""effective"" organization, led by ""strong"" leaders that allow short communication lines. Farmers who migrate to the same villages are organized into the same sub-groups, and migrations are arranged on a rotational base, so that there are always some farmers on the ground to look after the flood and to communicate timely with their village colleagues in the highlands, when additional labour is necessary. The paper discusses in detail these management practices and their impact on the livelihood of the farmers.

Along a southeast northwest gradient, the Chaco forest at low altitudes gives way to the Yungas cloud forest in highlands, and then, to an increasing desertic landscape, with xerophytic vegetation and scarce rainfall along the Grande River.

Only 19 were shared, meaning that 40 species are new for the area and/or particular localities, including 7 reports from Aguas Callentes. These results increase by one third the number of species in northwestern Argentina. The fish fauna was represented by eurytopic species of Paranensean genera as Astyanax, Bryconamericus and other characoids, mixed with locally distributed siluriforms.

Biogeochemistry,2005,"Merseburger, GC; Marti, E; Sabater, F",Net changes in nutrient concentrations below a point source input in two streams draining catchments with contrasting land uses,"We examined net changes in ammonium-Nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3--N), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) chloride-corrected ambient concentrations along a reach located below a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) input in a non-agricultural (12 dates) and an agricultural (6 dates) stream. Based on those net changes, we estimated processing length (Snet) and mass transfer coefficient (Vf) of the cited nutrients. In the agricultural stream, results suggest that diffuse nutrient inputs from adjacent agricultural fields had a greater effect on water chemistry than the WWTP input, and probably overwhelmed the stream capacity to retain and transform nutrients. In the non-agricultural stream we observed consistent longitudinal trends below the WWTP input only for NH4+ N and NO3--N. The tight coupling between longitudinal NO3--N decreases and NO3--N increases in the non-agricultural stream, and lack of longitudinal trends of DIN on most dates suggest that NH4+-N from the WWTP input was being nitrified along the reach. These results suggest that WWTP inputs favor conditions to support hot spots for chemoautotrophic activity. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Distinct habitat associations for every species were obtained, mainly relating Barbus comiza to the larger habitats and higher water levels, Barbus nucrocephalus to the maintenance of lotic conditions and Bat-bus sclateri to more fluctuating rivers. Barbus steindachneri showed a different habitat relationship from that of the genetically almost identical B. comiza. Cover played a significant role in all but B. comiza.

Samples were collected in six equidistant transects in three reaches located upstream (UP), few in below (DW1), and 500 in below the WWTP input (DW2). Our first objective was to assess the effects of the point source on the structure and functional organization of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Our second objective was to determine if the self-purifying capacity of the stream implied differences between the communities of the DW1 and the DW2 reaches. The WWTP input highly increased discharge, nutrient concentrations, and conductivity and decreased dissolved oxygen. At the DW1 and the DW2 reaches, taxa richness, EPT taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), and Shannon diversity decreased and gatherer relative density increased relative to the UP reach. At the UP reach, CPOM and FPOM standing crops were similar, whereas at the DW1 and the DW2 reaches CPOM was two times higher than FPOM. Detailed analysis showed that major changes in the benthic community occurred abruptly between 80 and 90 in downstream of the point source (middle of the DW1 reach). At this location, chlorophyll a concentration, density of macroin vertebrates, taxa richness, and scraper relative density increased, whereas gatherer relative percentage decreased. The macroinvertebrate community at the DW2 reach was comparable to that at the second middle of the DW1 reach (DW1B). The macroinvertebrate community at the DW1B and the DW2 reaches were quite similar to that at the UP reach, indicating that the recovery capacity of the stream from nutrient enrichment was high.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,545,,,289,302,,10.1007/s10750-005-3646-z,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000231958700024

Stable isotope analysis (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) together with linear mixing models, were used to quantify the importance of aquatic insects as a food source for a riparian arthropod assemblage inhabiting the shore of the braided Tagliamento River (NE Italy). Proportional aquatic prey contributions to riparian arthropod diets differed considerable among taxa. Carabid beetles of the genus Bembidion and Nebria picicornis fed entirely on aquatic insects. Aquatic insects made up 80% of the diet of the dominant staphylinid beetle Paederidus rubrothoracicus. The diets of the dominant lycosid spiders Arctosa cinerea and Pardosa wagleri consisted of 56 and 48% aquatic insects, respectively. In contrast, the ant Manica rubida fed mainly on terrestrial sources. The proportion of aquatic insects in the diet of lycosid spiders changed seasonally, being related to the seasonal abundance of lycosid spiders along the stream edge. The degree of spatial and seasonal aggregation of riparian arthropods at the river edge coincided with their proportional use of aquatic subsidies. The results suggest that predation by riparian arthropods is a quantitatively important process in the transfer of aquatic secondary production to the riparian food web.",ECOSYSTEMS,8,7,,748,759,,10.1007/s10021-005-0004-y,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000233326500002

We compared emergence of aquatic insects from predator-free exclosures and open cages to test the hypothesis that riparian arthropod predators can reduce the abundances of emerged aquatic insects. We used emergence traps over the aquatic and terrestrial sides of the shoreline to collect insects that emerged from the water or crawled onto land to emerge. The abundances and taxonomic composition of emerged aquatic insects and riparian arthropod predators changed seasonally. Riparian arthropods consumed 45% of emerged aquatic insect biomass from terrestrial traps in spring and 45% from aquatic traps in summer. The dominant riparian predator at the time of emergence determined the specific predation effect. Stoneflies that emerged into terrestrial traps were significantly reduced when ground beetles were the most abundant predators; caddisflies that emerged into aquatic traps were significantly reduced when spiders were the most abundant predators. Thus, taxon-specific predation by riparian arthropods can affect the taxonomic composition of emerged aquatic insects.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,24,2,,395,402,,10.1899/04-049.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000229309800014
Assessment,2005,"Pool, DR","Variations in climate and ephemeral channel recharge in southeastern Arizona, United States","Significant variations in interannual and decadal recharge rates are likely in alluvial basins of the semiarid southwestern United States on the basis of decadal variations in climate and precipitation and correlation of El Nino with high rates of winter precipitation and streamflow. A better understanding of the magnitude of recharge variations in semiarid and arid regions would reduce water budget uncertainty. Variability of ephemeral channel recharge with climate in southeastern Arizona was investigated through analysis of hydrologic monitoring near three ephemeral streams in southeastern Arizona during the middle to late 1990s and by relating the results to long-term hydrologic and climatic trends. The analysis used precipitation, streamflow, water levels in wells, estimates of groundwater storage change from repeat gravity surveys, and two climatic indicators of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Oscillation index, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Results indicate that variations in winter recharge are related to ENSO. El Nino conditions correspond with a greater probability of high rates of winter precipitation, streamflow, and recharge. La Nina conditions are almost exclusively associated with below-average recharge. Rates of recharge along Rillito Creek near Tucson during 1977-1998, a period of frequent El Nino conditions and positive PDO values, were 3 times recharge rates during 1941-1957, a period dominated by La Nina conditions and low PDO values. Quantification of recharge variability with decadal climate cycles should improve estimates of rates of aquifer drainage and replenishment in the region. Similar methods are applicable to other regions where thick unsaturated zones can accept significant periodic recharge.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,41,11,,,,W11403,10.1029/2004WR003255,,,,,,0043-1397,,WOS:000233164200001

Invertebrates colonized rapidly the litter bags maintained in both habitats, but densities were higher in bags incubated in the riffle.

Invertebrate,2005,"Robson, BJ; Hogan, M; Forrester, T",Hierarchical patterns of invertebrate assemblage structure in stony upland streams change with time and flow permanence,"1. Studies in several parts of the world have examined variation in univariate descriptors of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in perennially flowing stony streams across hierarchies of spatial scale using nested analyses of variance. However, few have investigated whether this spatial variation changes with time or whether these results are representative of habitats other than riffles or of other stream types, such as intermittently flowing streams.2. We describe patterns in taxon richness and abundance from two sets of samples from stony streams in the Otway Range and the Grampians Range, Victoria, Australia, collected using hierarchical designs. Sampling of riffles was repeated in the Otways, to determine whether spatial patterns were consistent among times. In the Grampians, spatial patterns were compared between intermittent and perennially flowing streams (stream type) by sampling pools.3. In the Otways streams, most variation in the dependent variables occurred between sample units. Patterns of variation among the other scales (streams, segments, riffles, groups of stones) were not consistent between sampling times, suggesting that they may have little ecological significance.4. In the Grampians streams, variation in macroinvertebrate taxon richness and abundance differed significantly between replicate streams within each stream type but not between stream types or pools. The largest source of variation in taxon richness was stream type. Little variation occurred among sample units.5. The pattern of most variation occurring among sample units is robust both to differences in the method of sampling and different dependent variables among studies and increasingly appears to be a property of riffles in stony, perennial upland streams. High variation among sample units (residual variation) limits the explanatory power of linear models and therefore, where samples are from a single sampling time, small but significant components of variation are unlikely to represent features of assemblage structure that will be stable over time.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,50,6,,944,953,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01376.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000229081600003
Assessment,2005,"Rovira, A; Batalla, RJ; Sala, M","Response of a river sediment budget after historical gravel mining (the Lower Tordera, NE Spain)","The channel of the lower Tordera River (Catalan Coastal Ranges) was intensively mined between 1956 and 1987, at an extraction rate 14 times higher than the replenishment rates. Mining caused incision of up to 2 m over the whole reach, leading to damage of infrastructures and affecting the groundwater system. In this paper we analyse the response of the river sediment budget by means of sediment transport measurements (both in suspension and as bedload) and topographic surveys. Historical data on mining activities was used to verify current values of sediment transport and to locate the main extraction areas in the long profile of the river. This has led to an integrated methodology that can be useful for assessing and managing current and future sediment deficits in heavily mined rivers. In the lower Tordera, a minimum of 3 million cubic metres of sand and gravel were extracted, especially from two gravel pits still visible as concavities in the river's longitudinal profile. Nowadays, 15 yr after mining ceased, the river shows during dry periods a general tendency towards aggradation (3.6 mm yr(-1) on average and up to 12 mm yr(-1) in central sections where mining took place), but a slight long-term tendency to erode the riverbed. Sediment yield at the entrance of the study reach attains 552 000 t yr(-1), while net sediment deposition reaches 16 400 t yr(-1) (78% as bedload), mostly during small floods in dry periods. Estimated time for the river to recover pre-extraction bed-level is of the order of 420 yr.

This addition increased the nutrient concentrations by 10 (phosphorus), 6 (ammonia) and 4 times (nitrates) with respect to basal concentrations. The effect of the enrichment on the structure and metabolism in benthic habitats (rocks, sand and leaf litter) was studied during a period of moderate light availability (maximum light at the streambed ranged between 20-120 mu E m(-2) s(-1)), prior to leaf occurrence in the riparian vegetation. A BACI design was used to determine the significance of the addition by comparing an upstream non-enriched (control) reach with a downstream enriched one (impacted). Nutrient addition caused a 3-fold increase in chlorophyll density on rocks and sand, and a remarkable increase in algal cell density, but did not cause changes in the community composition of the algal community. The increase in algal biomass was not reflected in higher net community metabolism (NCM) when this was measured as oxygen production, but higher carbon incorporation was detected at the end of the experiment. Nutrient addition did not significantly alter bacterial cell density on rocks, sand and leaf litter substrata. Accordingly, no substantial increase in community respiration (CR) was detected. Neither did heterotrophic activity (extracellular enzymes) change significantly because of addition, except for a decrease (although weak) in phosphatase in sand. Enrichment did not cause a general increase in macroinvertebrate density or biomass, but some taxa increased in the enriched reach. Scrapers (Ancylus fluviatilis) and detritivores (Oligochaeta, Lumbriculidae significantly augmented their density or biomass on certain substrata.

Br and (NH4-)-N-15 were added simultaneously to the surface stream to trace water and N from stream to riparian zone. Br concentrations in riparian wells installed downstream of the release point increased during the addition, demonstrating a strong hydrologic linkage from stream to riparian zone. Percentage stream water in wells increased in a downstream direction, Suggesting little or no input of water laterally from uplands or vertically from deep groundwater. Leaf and wood samples collected from willow trees downstream of the addition point became significantly labeled with N-15 during the addition, indicating uptake of streamwater N. Other tree species did not become labeled, most likely because they were located farther from the stream channel than the willows.

Despite their dominance in terms of Australia's river types, dryland rivers have not been the focus of the recent increase in research on indicators of river health, mostly owing to their spatial remoteness and relatively low levels of water resource development and human disturbance. Most rivers in arid and semi-arid regions are ephemeral, and only carry significant flows during the wetter months or following infrequent but intense rainfall events. It is not known which, if any, of the existing approaches to river health assessment can be used to accurately assess the health of these large ephemeral rivers.

The leaf C : N : P ratio was also examined for two non-native trees, saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and six species of dominant riparian arthropods.2. Living leaves and leaf litter of cottonwoods at flood sites had a significantly lower leaf N : P ratio and higher %P compared with leaves and litter at non-flood sites. A non-flood site downstream from wastewater effluent had a significantly lower litter C : N ratio than all other sites, suggesting N fertilisation through ground water. The non-native trees, saltcedar and Russian olive, had higher mean leaf N content, N : P ratio, and lower C : N ratio compared with cottonwoods across study sites.3. Riparian arthropods ranged from 5.2 to 7.1 for C : N ratio, 56-216 for C : P ratio, and 8.9-34 for N : P ratio. C content ranged from 25 to 52% of dry mass, N content from 4.7 to 10.8%, and P content from 0.59 to 1.2%. Differences in stoichiometry between high C : nutrient leaf litter and low C : nutrient invertebrates suggests possible food-quality constraints for detritivores.4. These results suggest that spatial and temporal variation in the C : N : P ratio of cottonwood leaves and leaf litter is influenced by surface and subsurface hydrologic connection within the floodplain.

The Vene drains a 67 km 2 rural basin, with a large karstic area, located in a Mediterranean context. A I day sampling campaign was conducted along the river, in winter low-flow conditions (February 2003). Physico-chemical parameters and water flow discharge were measured in situ during the sampling campaign. Water quality was evaluated by determining the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphor-us in water and bed-sediment samples. Nitrogen and phosphorus loads were evaluated taking into account the measured concentrations and discharge. The campaign included 18 sampling points and concerned the whole river from the spring to the outlet, plus the main inputs, i.e. sewage treatment works, main tributaries and karstic springs. The spatial evolution of nitrogen and phosphorus loads along the river allowed the significant role of point-source inputs to be demonstrated. The decrease in nutrient loads along the river occurred mainly in specific reaches where fine sediments had accumulated. In these zones, phosphorus is trapped in the bed sediments in calcium-bound phosphates due to precipitation processes.

Species native to the southeastern Pyrenees watershed were also significantly different from species native to the rest of the Iberian Peninsula but not native to this watershed. Iberian exotic species come predominantly from large river basins, whereas Catalan streams (and other small, coastal river basins) correspond to basins and streams of a smaller size and different hydrology, with differences in species composition and life-history traits of fish. The occurrence and spread of invasive species was not significantly related to life-history traits but to introduction date. The successful prediction of future invasive species is limited due to small differences in life-history and ecological traits between native and exotic species.

Experiments were conducted in a headwater agricultural watershed in North China to study the hydrological and ecological interactions between complex landscapes and nitrogen (N) flow. It was found that a series of artificial and natural buffer/detention landscape structures, which include four stone dams (SDs), a roadside grassed ditch (RGD), a vegetated filter strip (VFS), two dry ponds (DPs) and a riparian buffer zone (RBZ), distributed along the ephemeral stream, could effectively reduce the export load of sediment and N in surface runoff. During rainfall-runoff events, surface flow velocity and runoff volume were reduced from inlet to outlet of each structure. As a result, the retention rate of water by the system was determined to be 50.2%, total suspended solid (TSS) to be 72.7%, total nitrogen (TN) 66.1 %, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) 52.5%, NO(3)(-)43.6%. and NH4+ 51.6%, respectively. For different N forms, each structure had a different retention efficiency. Dry ponds and stone dams were more effective for particulate N, while the vegetated filter strip and riparian buffer zone were more effective for dissolved N forms. Dry ponds were the reliable structures for controlling sediment and N export in this watershed, while the retention efficiency of pollutants by the roadside grassed ditch was highly unreliable. The hydrological control by this system of flow velocity and runoff volume, which were the two key factors determining the export load of pollutants, was one of the main mechanisms in the retention of sediment and N. The use of diversified agricultural landscape buffer structures is an effective way to reduce the discharge of valuable nutrients and thus pollution of downstream waterbodies. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Crayfish were placed in cages and exposed to polluted environment during either 6 or 12 days in the three sites with different concentration of contaminants. Their tissues (exoskeleton + gills, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle) were dissected and analysed by ICP-MS to assess for concentration of Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and As. Both exposure times result in significant bioaccumulation of some metals in crayfish tissues as compared to their concentration in the environment. According to overall metal concentration, crayfish tissues rank as follows: hepatopancreas/viscera > exoskeleton/gills > abdominal muscle. Essential metals for crayfish metabolism (Cu and Zn) are always found in high concentrations independently of their quantities in the environment because of the ability of crayfish to manipulate their levels for their own metabolic profit. Metals not involved in crayfish metabolism (Cd, Pb, As) tend to increase with increasing concentration in the surrounding environment and with longer exposure times. Thus crayfish could be used as bioindicator of these pollutants because their dose- and time-dependent accumulation may be reflective of the levels of nonessential metals present in contaminated wetlands. Future guidelines in plans for monitoring contamination on polluted Mediterranean rivers and wetlands should take into account the implementation of the incubation of crayfish during 6 days and their subsequent analyses of metal contents, as a routine.

Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and SRP concentrations were negatively related to the algal biomass. Pool waters also had lower DIN concentrations at the vegetated areas and higher SPR concentrations at the bar head.

Patches of tamarisk (Tamarix), an introduced species, fell within the continuum of variation shown by other patch types in the landscape mosaic. Among the tree-dominated types, cottonwood-willow (Populus-Salix) and tamarisk patches were inundated more frequently than mesquite (Prosopis) patches, while cottonwood-willow patches had shallower groundwater than tamarisk or mesquite patches. Due to the wetter conditions, cottonwood-willow patches had a high relative abundance of wetland and exotic species in the understory. Tamarisk patches and wet shrublands (Baccharis salicifolia-Salix exigua) had high woody stem densities while cottonwood-willow patches had dense canopy cover. In association with differences in canopy cover, cottonwood-willow patches had low herbaceous species richness but high woody species richness, while tamarisk patches had high herbaceous and low woody species richness. Soil electrical conductivity, silt content, organic matter content, and available phosphorus increased from young to old stands of both tamarisk and cottonwood-willow, often resulting in greater differences between patches of different size/age class than between patches with different dominant species. Surface soil salinity (electrical conductivity) was low in all patches, including those dominated by tamarisk.

Given that fish persist in these systems under conditions of high environmental variability, dryland rivers represent ideal systems to investigate the processes contributing to and sustaining fish biodiversity and recruitment in variable environments. Hence, spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure was examined in 15 waterholes of the Warrego River between October 2001 and May 2003. Fish assemblages in isolated waterholes were differentiated at the end of the dry 2001 winter but were relatively similar following high summer flows in January 2002 as a consequence of high hydrological connectivity among waterholes. Small, shallow waterholes supported more species and higher abundances than large-deep waterholes. Large, deep waterholes provided important refuge for large-bodied fish species such as adult yellowbelly, Macquaria ambigua, and the eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Recruitment patterns of bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), Hyrtl's tandan (Neosilurus hyrtlii) and yellowbelly were associated with high flow events and backwater inundation; however recruitment of yellowbelly and bony bream was also evident following a zero-flow period.

We investigated the seasonal variation of biological traits and the influence of interannual rainfall variability on this pattern. Using long-term survey data (6-19 years) from an intermittent and a perennial stream in the Mediterranean-climate region of northern California, we examined 16 fuzzy-coded biological traits (e.g. maximum size, life cycle duration, and mode of respiration).2. Seasonal habitat variability is higher in the intermittent stream than in the perennial stream. During the winter and spring wet-season both streams flood; however, during the summer dry-season, the intermittent stream forms isolated pools in (occasionally drying completely).3. Seasonal habitat variability influenced both taxonomic and biological trait composition. Distinct taxonomic communities were present in each season, particularly in the intermittent stream. The intermittent stream also exhibited more seasonal variation in biological traits than the perennial stream.4. Despite statistically significant seasonal variation, trait composition was relatively stable among seasons in comparison with taxonomic composition and abundance. Taxonomic composition varied considerably between seasons, because of high seasonal and interannual replacement of taxa resulting from seasonal habitat changes.5. The seasonality of taxonomic composition and abundance was sensitive to interannual rainfall variability. In dry years, the taxonomic composition of communities was more similar between seasons than in wet years, while trait composition was relatively insensitive to rainfall variability.6. Despite high seasonal variation in abundance and taxonomic composition, biological traits of aquatic macroinvertebrates varied less and exhibited seasonal stability, which may be a result of the unpredictability and harshness of stream environments.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,51,1,,56,75,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000233834400005

The study was performed in the Fuirosos catchment (10.5 km(2)) drained by an intermittent stream. Water sources were estimated through end member mixing analysis (EMMA) using chloride, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon as tracers. Three end members were identified in the catchment: event water, hillslope groundwater and riparian groundwater. Streamwater data encompassed the mixing space defined by the end members only during the 12 storms occurred during the wet period (from December to May). Water sources were related to stream nitrate concentrations during 6 of the 12 storms indicating a linkage between hydrological and nitrate sources. However, there was not a consistent pattern of a particular end member being a source of nitrate. EMMA was used to determine expected nitrate concentrations in stream water based on conservative mixing of the different water sources. The effect of the near- and in- stream zones on stream nitrate was inferred by comparing predicted nitrate concentrations to measured stream nitrate concentration. At discharges below 80 l s(-1) stream nitrate concentrations were lower than expected from catchment sources in 82% of the cases suggesting nitrate retention in the near stream zones.

The most commonly used RBPs in South Africa (SA-protocol) and the Iberian Peninsula (IB-protocol) are both multihabitat, field-based methods that use macroinvertebrates. Both methods use preassigned sensitivity weightings to calculate metrics and biotic indices. The SA- and IB-protocols differ with respect to sampling equipment (mesh size: 1000 mu m vs 250-300 pm, respectively), segregation of habitats (substrate vs flow-type), and sampling and sorting procedures (variable time and intensity). Sampling was undertaken at 6 sites in South Africa and 5 sites in the Iberian Peninsula. Forty-four and 51 macroinvertebrate families were recorded in South Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, respectively; 77.3% of South African families and 74.5% of Iberian Peninsula families were found using both protocols. Estimates of community similarity compared between the 2 protocols were > 60% similar among sites in South Africa and > 54% similar among sites in the Iberian Peninsula (Bray-Curtis similarity), and no significant differences were found between protocols (Multiresponse Permutation Procedure). Ordination based on Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling grouped macroinvertebrate samples on the basis of site rather than protocol. Biotic indices generated with the 2 protocols at each site did not differ. Thus, both RBPs produced equivalent results, and both were able to distinguish between biotic communities (mountain streams vs foothills) and detect water-quality impairment, regardless of differences in sampling equipment, segregation of habitats, and sampling and sorting procedures. Our results indicate that sampling a single habitat may be sufficient for assessing water quality, but a multihabitat approach to sampling is recommended where intrinsic variability of macroinvertebrate assemblages is high (e.g., in undisturbed sites in regions with Mediterranean climates).

Invertebrate,2006,"Bonada, N; Rieradevall, M; Prat, N; Resh, VH",Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and macrohabitat connectivity in Mediterranean-climate streams of northern California,"Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,25,1,,32,43,,10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[32:BMAAMC]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000236565400004

A method for assessing fish-habitat assemblages at multiple scales is proposed and tested in a large Australian dryland river, the Barwon-Darling River. Six discrete mesohabitat types (large wood, smooth bank, irregular bank, matted bank, mid-channel and deep pool) nested within 10 km long river reaches were sampled. Individual reaches were, in turn, nested within four larger geomorphological zones, previously identified along the river. Fish assemblages varied significantly between mesohabitat types and at different spatial scales. Golden perch (Macquaria ambigua), Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were strongly associated with large wood, but golden perch and Murray cod exhibited higher habitat specificity than carp. Bony herring (Nematalosa erebi) were more common in shallow edgewater habitats. At the river-scale, regional differences in the fish assemblage occurred at scales closely corresponding to geomorphological zones and these differences were associated with changes in the relative abundance of species rather than the addition or replacement of species. The proposed hierarchical framework improves the efficiency of fish surveys in large rivers by viewing meso-scale fish-habitat associations in the context of larger-scale geomorphological processes.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,572,,,11,31,,10.1007/s10750-005-0004-0,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000240911100002

Fish,2006,"Bunn, SE; Thoms, MC; Hamilton, SK; Capon, SJ","Flow variability in dryland rivers: Boom, bust and the bits in between","Australian dryland rivers are acknowledged as being among the most variable and unpredictable in the world in terms of their flow regimes. Although renowned for their spectacular floods over vast and complex floodplains, rivers exist for much of the time as discrete waterholes, which are important refugia for aquatic biota. Recent work has shown that waterholes are filled by surface flows and there is little evidence of groundwater contributions. The permanence of these refugia is largely determined by waterhole morphology and evaporative loss, and some waterholes can clearly persist for 2 years or more without surface flow connection. As a consequence, the spatial distribution of refugia for aquatic biota is determined not only by the physical template but also by the duration of dry spells and the timing of flow events. Flow variability also has a major influence on aquatic production in these systems and ultimately influences food availability for fish and other consumers. During dry spells, aquatic food webs in waterholes are largely supported by algal production in the shallow littoral zone. At the other extreme, during floods, the boom of aquatic production on floodplains provides an immense food resource. However, there are many occasions when in-channel flows (flow pulses) result in periods where neither of these sources of production is likely to be available. Although such flow pulses are essential for the physical persistence and connectivity of waterholes, we propose that they may lead to food limitation and stress for populations of fish and other consumers. Water resource development in dryland rivers often leads to an increase in the frequency and duration of flow pulses, due to reduced floods and elevated base flows. This increase in the 'bits in between' natural boom or bust conditions may help to explain the observed decline in ecosystem health in dryland river systems with significant water resource development.

The study had two aims: (1) to examine whether the variability of solute hysteretic loops monitored in different streams during cold seasons followed a consistent and recurring pattern, (2) to identify hydrological parameters which could potentially influence features of the DOC and NO(3) hysteresis. Relationships between hysteresis features and hydrological parameters in the studied streams were explored using multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA). Both DOC and NO(3) typically increased in concentration during storm events, although hysteretic loops did not obey any consistent pattern across the three streams. The rotational patterns of DOC and NO(3) hysteresis ranged widely, from clockwise to counterclockwise.

Episodic floods and extended low or no flow periods characterise dryland river systems in Western Queensland, Australia. During protracted intervals between floods, rivers consist of a series of isolated waterholes, which serve as 'refugia' for aquatic species and much of the channel is dry. We categorised these waterholes into 'main waterholes', which are located in the main part of the river channel and 'satellite waterholes', which are located in distributary river channels.2. We used mitochondrial sequences and allozymes to investigate levels of genetic diversity and patterns of connectivity among waterholes for two obligate freshwater species: Macrobrachium australiense (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) and Notopala sublineata (Gastropoda: Viviparidae).3. We sampled 31 waterholes for M. australiense and 12 for N. sublineata. Based on a 505-bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit I, we identified 54 haplotypes in a sample of 232 individuals for M. australiense and based on a 457-bp fragment of the same gene, 36 haplotypes in a sample of 145 individuals for N. sublineata.4. Both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic data sets indicated that estimates of genetic diversity were not different in populations inhabiting main and satellite waterholes for either species. Also, there was generally very limited genetic differentiation among populations at any site.5. We suggest that levels of connectivity among populations inhabiting waterholes at most sites are higher than expected. High levels of connectivity may help to maintain overall high levels of genetic diversity as well as low levels of genetic differentiation among waterholes within sites.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,51,8,,1434,1446,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01585.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000239600400004
Assessment,2006,"Cowell, Amanda L.; Matthews, Ty G.; Lind, Peter R.",Effect of fire on benthic algal assemblage structure and recolonization in intermittent streams,"Dry biofilm on rocks and other substrata forms an important drought refuge for benthic algae in intermittent streams following the cessation of flow. This dry biofilm is potentially susceptible to disturbance from bushfires, including direct burning and/or scorching and damage from radiant heat, particularly when streams are dry. Therefore, damage to dry biofilms by fire has the potential to influence algal recolonization and assemblage structure in intermittent streams following commencement of flow. The influence of fire on benthic algal assemblages and recolonization was examined in intermittent streams of the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia, using a field survey and manipulative field experiment. The field survey compared assemblages in two intermittent streams within a recently burnt area (within 5 months of the fire) with two intermittent streams within an unburnt area. The two burnt streams were still flowing during the fire so most biofilms were not likely to be directly exposed to flames. Considerable site-to-site and stream-to-stream variation was detected during the field survey, which may have obscured potential differences attributable to indirect effects of the fire. The manipulative field experiment occurred in two intermittent streams and consisted of five treatments chosen to replicate various characteristics of bus fires that may influence dry biofilms: dry biofilm exposed directly to fire; dry biofilm exposed to radiant heat; dry biofilm exposed to ash; and two procedural controls. After exposure to the different treatments, rocks were replaced in the streams and algae were sampled 7 days after flow commenced. Differences occurred across treatments, but treatment differences were inconsistent across the two streams. For example, direct exposure to fire reduced the abundance of recolonizing algae and altered assemblage structure in both streams, while radiant heat had an effect on assemblage structure in one stream only. The manipulative field experiment is likely to have represented the intensity of a small bushfire only. Nonetheless, significant differences across treatments were detected, so these experimental results suggest that fire can damage dry biofilms, and hence, influence algal recolonization and assemblage structure in intermittent streams.",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,31,6,,696,707,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01595.x,,,,,,1442-9985; 1442-9993,,WOS:000240562700003

Understanding the scale at which land use influences nutrient loading is necessary for the development of management practices and policies that improve water quality. The authors assessed the relationships between land use and stream nutrients in a prairie watershed dominated by intermittent stream flow in the first-order higher elevation reaches. Total nitrogen, nitrate, and phosphorus concentrations were greater in tributaries occupying the lower portions of the watershed, closely mirroring the increased density of row crop agriculture from headwaters to lower-elevation alluvial areas. Land cover classified at three spatial scales in each sub-basin above sampling sites (riparian in the entire catchment, catchment land cover, and riparian across the 2 km upstream) was highly correlated with variation in both total nitrogen (r(2) = 53%, 52%, and 49%, respectively) and nitrate (r(2) = 69%, 65%, and 56%, respectively) concentrations among sites. However, phosphorus concentrations were not significantly associated with riparian or catchment land cover classes at any spatial scale. Separating land use from riparian cover in the entire watershed was difficult, but riparian cover was most closely correlated with in-stream nutrient concentrations. By controlling for land cover, a significant correlation of riparian cover for the 2 km above the sampling site with in-stream nutrient concentrations could be established. Surprisingly, land use in the entire watershed, including small intermittent streams, had a large influence on average downstream water quality although the headwater streams were not flowing for a substantial portion of the year. This suggests that nutrient criteria may not be met only by managing permanently flowing streams.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,37,5,,634,646,,10.1007/s00267-004-0072-3,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:000236423200005

This study examined the relationship between stream discharge and suspended sediment concentration near the Sage Creek and North Platte River confluence from 1998 through 2003. The objectives were to determine patterns of stream discharge and suspended sediment concentration, produce a sediment prediction model, and compare sediment concentrations for the six-year period. Stream discharge and suspended sediment transport responded rapidly to convective storms and spring runoff events. During the study period, events exceeding 0.23 m(3)/s accounted for 92 percent of the sediment load, which is believed to originate from erodible headwater uplands. Further analysis of these data indicates that time series modeling is superior to simple linear regression in predicting sediment concentration.

Estimated mean surface area of live riparian roots within sediments was 1084 cm(2) m(-3). Streambed temperatures showed greater fluctuation at the clearcut site compared to thinned and reference treatments. However, breakdown rates among buried substrate types or riparian treatments did not differ after 1 y. Slow decay rates were associated initially with anaerobic conditions within sandy sediments and later with dry sediment conditions.

The state of severe degradation of the slopes due to gullying, the permanent moisture deficit in the soils and the devastating force of wadi floods are the consequence of an environment affected by rill wash and subjected to intensified mechanical erosion. This dynamics is highlighted not only by landscapes, but also by erosion pins placed in several gullies and the monitoring of several wadis between 1999 and 2001. This situation is not only due to the physical and historical past, but also to a combination of recent climatic and human impacts affecting cultural practices and land use. Here, an overview of the situation is presented, and monitoring and quantification of the human impact are based on the measurement of rill wash and soil loss on test plots. The results show that fallow land appears to be the land use category most susceptible to erosion and that expansion towards fallow areas of sites already degraded by erosion occurs through the growth of erosional landforms that were initiated during the first year after cultivation has ceased.

Leaf-litter breakdown rates (/d) were faster in temperate (k = 0.023-0.017) than in tropical (k = 0.014) or Mediterranean (k = 0.014-0.009) streams. Leaf-litter breakdown rates (/degree day) also were higher in the temperate stream (k = 0.0018-0.0032) and similar between the other 2 streams (k = 0.008-0.0012). Colonization of leaves by aquatic hyphomycetes was faster in the temperate stream (maximum = 421 mu g ergosterol/g of leaf by day 24) than in the tropical Cerrado or Mediterranean streams. However, peak ergosterol content was highest in the tropical Cerrado stream (573 mu g/g on day 75). Ergosterol content was lowest in the Mediterranean stream (maximum= 341 mu g/g on day 7). Total microbial biomass (as ATP) was higher in the tropical Cerrado stream (maximum = 531 nmoles/g on day 75) than in the Mediterranean (maximum = 108 nmoles/g on day 92) and temperate (maximum = 93 nmoles/g on day 7) streams. These results suggest either that not all microorganisms associated with leaves were involved in leaf-litter breakdown or that other less efficient microorganisms than fungi were involved in leaf-litter breakdown in the tropical stream. Leaves exposed to invertebrates (coarse-mesh bags) decomposed significantly faster than leaves protected from invertebrate feeding (fine-mesh bags) only in the temperate stream. This result suggests that invertebrates were important mediators of leaf-litter breakdown only in the temperate stream. A larger proportion of invertebrates recovered from decomposing leaves were shredders in the temperate stream (nearly 5%) than in the Mediterranean (1%) and tropical Cerrado (0%) streams. Leaf-litter processing rates increased with discharge and NO3 concentration in the water. Our results suggest that the positive effect of temperature on breakdown rates of allochthonous organic matter in streams can be overridden by nutrient content in the water and the presence of invertebrate shredders.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,25,2,,344,355,,10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[344:LBISIT]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000237891600007
Invertebrate,2006,"Hancock, Peter J.","The response of hyporheic invertebrate communities to a large flood in the Hunter River, New South Wales","Previous studies on recovery in hyporheic communities have found that communities rapidly return to pre-disturbance levels. However, most of these studies have concentrated on small floods or ones with short return periods. I studied the impact of a large 1 in 6 year flood on the hyporheic community at 2 sites in the Hunter River, a large coastal river in New South Wales with a mean daily flow of 15 m(3) s(-1). The flood peaked at 1270 m(3) s(-1) and afterwards invertebrate densities at the 2 sites were 83 and 67% less than they were before. Recovery to pre-flood densities was slow but was aided by increases in the oligochaete and cyclopoid populations. At Site 1, there was a boom in oligochaete and cyclopoid numbers 61 d after the flood, but the communities resumed their pre-flood densities by Day 139. Recovery at Site 2 took 139 d. Most groundwater taxa (stygobites) living in the hyporheic zone did not recover from the disturbance when compared to non-stygobites. Apart from Microturbellaria and the harpacticoid Parastenocaris sp., numbers of all stygobite taxa continued to decline after the flood, becoming absent after 61 d. The poor recovery of stygobites is probably due to their adaptations for survival in the relatively stable groundwater environment. This study shows that hyporheic communities are sensitive to large bed-moving floods and supports the hypothesis that ecotonal species with a strong affinity to one ecosystem can be poor at recovering from disturbances that occur in an adjacent ecosystem.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,568,,,255,262,,10.1007/s10750-006-0110-7,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000239393800020
Assessment,2006,"Hooke, J. M.",Human impacts on fluvial systems in the Mediterranean region,"The long history of substantial human impacts on the landscape of the Mediterranean region, and their effects on fluvial systems, is documented. These effects have included impacts of deforestation and other land use changes, agricultural terracing on a wide scale, water transfers, and irrigation schemes. During the 20th century, major changes were made directly to channels through channelisation, construction of dams of various sizes, and extraction of gravel, and indirectly by reforestation. These changes have caused a major phase of incision on some rivers. Runoff and soil erosion have been affected by types of crops and agricultural practices as well as by the varying extent of cultivation and grazing. Some recent agricultural practices involve wholescale relandscaping of the topography and alteration of surface properties of material. The importance of analysing the connectivity within different land units and of the spatial position of human activity within a catchment is illustrated. The analysis of connectivity is the key to understanding the variability of impact and the extent of propagation of effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study area constituted two major catchments, Cooper and Darling, representing arid and semiarid systems, respectively. Results generally conformed to expectations, with high levels of gene flow observed within catchments and limited contemporary gene flow evident across catchment boundaries. However, the isolation between catchments was more recent than expected, occurring approximately 40 000-72 000 years ago. Also contrary to predictions, genetic structure within the Cooper catchment did not fit the stream hierarchy model of genetic differentiation, which there was evidence of in the Darling catchment. This was hypothesized to relate to the different climatic regimes and hydrological inputs in each system, leading to a more genetically homogeneous system in the Cooper than in the Darling system.

Chemical analyses show a clear increase in the values of parameters related to organic loading below the discharge sites. In this sector, the abundance and richness of stygobitic species, mainly Crustacea Peracarida, are very low.

Biogeochemistry,2006,"Lewis, DB; Schade, JD; Huth, AK; Grimm, NB","The spatial structure of variability in a semi-arid, fluvial ecosystem","The arrangement and composition of flowpath types within a given network are thought to govern its functioning. This concept assumes that different flowpath types are functionally distinct. We investigated this assumption in a fluvial ecosystem by comparing the riparian zone, parafluvial zone (in-channel gravel bars), and surface stream. We hypothesized that differences in advection, uptake, and sorption would render material cycles more (a) open and (b) mutable in the surface stream, whereas the converse would occur in the riparian zone, and an intermediate state would be seen in the intervening parafluvial zone. To test our first hypothesis, we predicted that spatial heterogeneity in solute concentrations would be least in the surface stream, greater in the parafluvial zone, and greatest in the riparian zone. Using a null model, we ascertained that this pattern was shown by all solute species we examined (nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved inorganic nitrogen [DIN], dissolved organic N, total dissolved N, soluble reactive phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and chloride). To test our second hypothesis, we predicted that temporal change in spatial heterogeneity would be greatest in the surface stream, less in the parafluvial zone, and least in the riparian zone. Nitrate, DIN, and chloride showed this pattern. In particular, surface stream inorganic N was less spatially variable following months of high rainfall. According to an extant hypothesis, these results suggest that inorganic N processing may be a stable function in this ecosystem. Other solute species did not support our second prediction, perhaps because their retention and release dynamics are influenced principally by geochemistry. Generally, our findings indicate that a geomorphic template can generate spatial patterns in ecosystem function, warranting an expansion of the spiraling framework to a variety of flowpath types.",ECOSYSTEMS,9,3,,386,397,,10.1007/s10021-005-0161-z,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000237121600006
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2006,"Lind, P. R.; Robson, B. J.; Mitchell, B. D.",The influence of reduced flow during a drought on patterns of variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages across a spatial hierarchy in two lowland rivers,"1. With the aim of determining whether patterns of variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition across the hierarchy of spatial units in two lowland rivers changed during a supra-seasonal drought (1997-2000), patterns during a reduced flow season (1999-2000) were compared with those during two preceding higher flow seasons (1997-98 and 1998-99) using samples from the Glenelg and Wimmera Rivers, two lowland regulated rivers in western Victoria, Australia.2. We hypothesised that (i) differences between reaches would increase during the reduced flow season owing to decreased hydrological connectivity, (ii) differences between the habitats would decrease because the cessation of flow in run habitats should cause them to become more similar to pool habitats and (iii) differences between microhabitats would also decrease because of reduced scour of inorganic substrata and large woody debris.3. During each season, macroinvertebrates were sampled from three microhabitats (sand/silt substratum, large woody debris and macrophytes) that were hierarchically nested within a run or pool habitat and within one of three reaches within each river. A range of physico-chemical variables was also sampled.4. Analysis of similarity showed that assemblage composition in both rivers during the higher flow seasons differed more among microhabitats than other spatial units. However, during the reduced flow season, assemblage composition in the Wimmera River differed most among reaches. This change in pattern was associated with the combined effects of decreased flow and longitudinal increases in salinity. In contrast, the fauna of the Glenelg River appeared to be resistant to the effects of the reduced flow season, owing to limited decline in water quality despite lower river discharge.5. As salinisation and poor water quality in the Wimmera River result from human activities in the catchment, these results support the idea that human impacts on rivers can change macroinvertebrate scaling patterns and exacerbate the effects of drought beyond the tolerance of many riverine macroinvertebrates.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,51,12,,2282,2295,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01650.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000242487400008

F.",Conservation importance of semi-arid streams in north-eastern Brazil: implications of hydrological disturhance and species diversity,"1. Intermittent streams in the semi-arid region of Brazil are distinctive landscape features existing as dry watercourses for most of the time. It has been recognized that the extremes of flooding and total absence of water flow are the principal hydrological characteristics of rivers and streams in this region. This is a consequence of complex climatic patterns that lead to an irregular distribution of the small amount of rainfall and low thermal amplitude. The latter is the main climatic difference between the Brazilian semi-arid region and other semi-arid lands.2. The expansion of water resource development has been a threat to the natural flow regime and the ecological integrity of rivers and streams in semi-arid Brazil. Efforts to manage and conserve the natural flow regime of these systems are hampered by limited scientific information on the ecological processes driving their flora and fauna and the responses of biota to the high natural variability in flow regime.3. The most important issues in the conservation of streams in semi-arid Brazil are the need for their recognition as important sites of biodiversity and that this diversity is closely associated with natural patterns of flow and the hydrological disturbances. Without the understanding of how the extremes of flooding and drought affect the aquatic fauna, the conservation strategies for Brazilian semi-arid streams and their fauna will not be effective.4. Therefore, conservation efforts in semi-arid Brazil must ensure that the processes sustaining biodiversity are maintained at multiple-scale and landscape levels and that the natural integrity of the riparian zone is maintained Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,16,7,,665,677,,10.1002/aqc.805,,,,,,1052-7613; 1099-0755,,WOS:000242291700002

Spatial changes in the macroinvertebrate assemblages of 15 of these waterholes belonging to four regions were explored and these changes were related to environmental aspects of the waterholes measured at four spatial scales: floodplain, waterhole, within waterhole and sample habitat. To explore temporal patterns, one region was sampled on four occasions differing in time since connection. Spatial patterns were characterised by 'differentiation by distance' whereby samples collected closer to each other in the landscape were more similar in assemblage composition than those collected further apart. Thus, there were significant differences between the assemblages of the four regions. Although there was a correlation between macroinvertebrate spatial patterns and a combination of local habitat, geomorphology and water chemistry attributes, it appears unlikely that these variables were responsible for the faunal differentiation by distance. Temporal variability was larger than spatial variability and temporal assemblage patterns were best explained by the ` connectivity potential' of waterholes, reflecting the position of individual waterholes within the broader channel network and long-term connectivity relationships, rather than the actual time since hydrological connection.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,57,1,,61,74,,10.1071/MF05021,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000234700500006

This is often because it is cheaper to obtain family level data than species level data. Choice of appropriate taxonomic resolution is a compromise between the cost of obtaining data at high taxonomic resolutions and the loss of information at lower resolutions. Optimum taxonomic resolution should be determined by the information required to address programme objectives. Costs saved in identifying macroinvertebrates to family level may not be justified if family level data can not give the answers required and expending the extra cost to obtain species level data may not be warranted if cheaper family level data retains sufficient information to meet objectives. We investigated the influence of taxonomic resolution and sample quantification (abundance vs. presence/absence) on the representation of aquatic macroinvertebrate species assemblage patterns and species richness estimates. The study was conducted in a physically harsh dryland river system (Condamine-Balonne River system, located in south-western Queensland, Australia), characterised by low macroinvertebrate diversity. Our 29 study sites covered a wide geographic range and a diversity of lotic conditions and this was reflected by differences between sites in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and richness. The usefulness of expending the extra cost necessary to identify macroinvertebrates to species was quantified via the benefits this higher resolution data offered in its capacity to discriminate between sites and give accurate estimates of site species richness. We found that very little information (< 6%) was lost by identifying taxa to family (or genus), as opposed to species, and that quantifying the abundance of taxa provided greater resolution for pattern interpretation than simply noting their presence/absence. Species richness was very well represented by genus, family and order richness, so that each of these could be used as surrogates of species richness if, for example, surveying to identify diversity hot-spots. It is suggested that sharing of common ecological responses among species within higher taxonomic units is the most plausible mechanism for the results. Based on a cost/benefit analysis, family level abundance data is recommended as the best resolution for resolving patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages in this system. The relevance of these findings are discussed in the context of other low diversity, harsh, dryland river systems.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,572,,,171,194,,10.1007/s10750-005-9007-0,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000240911100011

This study addresses this issue, by examining the contribution of local habitat attributes and landscape context to fish assemblage variation across small Mediterranean drainages in southern Portugal. Fish abundance and species composition was estimated in 28 sites, across 10 drainages, in both a dry year (1999) and a wet year (2001), and related to two sets of variables reflecting habitat and landscape characteristics. Fish showed responses to both sets of variables with variance partitioning indicating that landscape context had important effects on species richness whereas habitat attributes were the primary determinants of local fish abundance. In general, high species richness was associated with larger drainage area and higher rainfall variability, whereas variation in species abundances mostly reflected the influence of width, depth, conductivity, current velocity, substrate size and emergent vegetation. The relative contributions of both landscape context and habitat attributes to species richness and abundance were generally lower in 1999 than in 2001, with much less diversified species-habitat relationships being found in the former dry year. These results point to the dynamic nature of assemblage organization, emphasizing the importance of innovative, multi-scale approaches in advancing our knowledge of fish assemblage structure in Mediterranean streams.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,77,2,,105,120,,10.1007/s10641-006-9058-8,,,,,,0378-1909,,WOS:000240362100001

An ordination analysis, based on 16 variables, was applied to species presence, using principal component and canonical correspondence analysis. The results for the habitat data were compared with those for the biological data using a Mantel analysis, and the agreement was highly significant. Spatial structure was considered by partitioning the total variability among the environmental and geographical variables. The fish assemblages showed longitudinal zoning during the summer, with species distributed over gradients of habitat size (depth), water quality (current and physico-chemical variables), and cover (substratum and vegetation), according to their adult size and life history. The size of the habitat that remained available in summer had the greatest biological effect, being the most important factor explaining fish species distribution and assemblage structure during this stressing season. Strictly spatial variation was low, but there was still a high residual variation. Habitat associations and life-history strategies are discussed for native and exotic species.

Invertebrate,2006,"Paetzold, A; Bernet, JF; Tockner, K",Consumer-specific responses to riverine subsidy pulses in a riparian arthropod assemblage,"1. Aquatic resource fluxes from streams can provide significant subsidies for riparian consumers. Because aquatic resource fluxes can be highly variable in space and time, the subsidy efficiency (i.e. transfer to the recipient food web) is controlled by the short-term aggregative response of riparian consumers.2. Field manipulations of stream-derived invertebrate prey subsidies were used to examine specific aggregative responses of ground-dwelling arthropods to riverine subsidy pulses in a braided-river (Tagliamento River, NE Italy). Subsidy manipulation comprised short-term reductions of natural stream-derived subsidies and increased subsidies of stream-derived invertebrate prey during four seasons.3. We hypothesised that specific aggregative responses of riparian arthropods depend on their specialisation on aquatic insects which was inferred from stable isotope analysis. Natural riverine subsidy sources including aquatic insect emergence and surface-drifting organisms were quantified.4. Arthropods responded significantly with a reduction in abundance by 51%, at reduced subsidies and an increase by 110% at increased subsidies, when averaged over all seasons. Different arthropod taxa responded differently to subsidy manipulations in relation to their specialisation on aquatic subsidies: ground beetles with a diet consisting predominantly of aquatic insects responded only to subsidy reductions, indicating that their local abundance was not limited by natural stream-derived subsidies; lycosid spiders with a partly aquatic diet showed no significant response; and ants, although relying on a terrestrial diet, responded positively to added stream-derived invertebrate prey, indicating that stranding of surface-drifting terrestrial invertebrates represented an important subsidy pathway.5. Ground beetles and lycosid spiders were seasonally separated in their use of aquatic subsidies. Results indicate that the life-history characteristics of riparian consumers can control the subsidy efficiency for the recipient community. By the effective uptake of pulsed riverine-derived subsidies, riparian arthropods can enhance the transfer of riverine food sources to the riparian food web.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,51,6,,1103,1115,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01559.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000237692800010

The study area consisted of two ephemeral streams, Burger Draw and Sue Draw. These streams are tributaries to the perennial Powder River, Wyoming. Samples were collected bimonthly from three CBM discharge points and seven channel locations in Burger Draw and Sue Draw. Samples were also collected bimonthly from the Powder River above and below the confluence of Burger Draw.

Samples were transported to the laboratory and analyzed for dissolved trace elements including iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), boron (B), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and fluoride (F). Results suggest pH of discharge water was 7.1 and increased significantly in the downstream channel of Burger Draw to 8.84 before joined with the Powder River. Temperature of CBM produced water at discharge points ranged between 20.3 and 22.7 degrees C. Before discharge, DO concentrations of CBM produced water were between 1.42 and 1.5 mg/L. No significant differences in temperature, DO, and turbidity were found between Burger Draw flow and Powder River flow.

Assessment,2006,"Pederson, JL; Petersen, PA; Dierket, JL","Gullying and erosion control at archaeological sites in Grand Canyon, Arizona","Gully erosion of cultural sites in Grand Canyon National Park is an urgent management problem that has intensified in recent decades, potentially related to the effects of Glen Canyon Dam. We studied 25 gullies at nine sites in Grand Canyon over the 2002 monsoon-erosion season to better understand the geomorphology of the gully erosion and the effectiveness of erosion-control structures (ECS) installed by the park under the direction of the Zuni Conservation Program. Field results indicate that Hortonian overland flow leads to concentrated flow in gullies and erosion focused at knickpoints along channels as well as at gully heads. Though groundcover type, soil shear strength and permeability vary systematically across catchments, gradient and, to a lesser degree, contributing drainage area seem to be the first-order controls on gully extent, location of new knickpoints, and ECS damage. The installed ECS do reduce erosion relative to reaches without them and initial data suggest woody checkdams are preferable to rock linings, but maintenance is essential because damaged structures can exacerbate erosion.Topographic data from intensive field surveys and detailed photogrammetry provide slope-contributing area data for gully heads that have a trend consistent with previous empirical and theoretical formulations from a variety of landscapes. The same scaling holds below gully heads for knickpoint and ECS topographic data, with threshold coefficients the lowest for gully heads, slightly higher for knickpoints, and notably higher for damaged ECS. These topographic thresholds were used with 10-cm digital elevation models to create simple predictive models for gully extent and structure damage. The model predictions accounted for the observed gullies but there are also many false-positives. Purely topographical models are probably inadequate at this scale and application, but models that also parameterize the variable soil properties across sites would be useful for predicting erosion problems and ECS failure.

The prevalence and mean abundance of A. polycotyleus on gills of B. neumayeri was highest in the hypoxic swamp habitat, followed by the intermittent stream sites, and faster flowing river sites. Parasite prevalence and mean abundance across habitats were negatively related to both water current and dissolved oxygen concentration. Within hosts, A. polycotyleus was strongly specific among hemibranchs in poorly oxygenated water and was found on arch 2, hemibranch 4 most frequently.",JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY,92,6,,1211,1217,,10.1645/GE-621R.1,,,,,,0022-3395,,WOS:000243959800011

We tested whether Phylloicus was able to discriminate among leaf species, and whether leaf species affected its growth rate. The native leaf species selected for the study were: Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae), Ficus sp. (Moraceae), Hura crepitans (Euphorbiaceae), and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae). Phylloicus larvae and leaves of native tree species were collected from Cano Carichuano, a 2nd-order intermittent stream located in northwestern Venezuela. Larvae were acclimated to laboratory conditions, and leaves were air dried and stored before beginning the experiments. Additional leaves were used to determine initial chemical composition (11, lignin, N, and polyphenols). Feeding experiments were conducted in which larvae were given a choice of different leaf species. Phylloicus preferred to feed on leaf species with high nutrient content and low lignin and polyphenol concentrations (Ficus sp.) and rejected leaves with low nutrient content and high lignin and polyphenol concentrations (Anacardium). However, Phylloicus selected Anacardium leaves for case-building.

The factors responsible for their decline are many and varied. However the primary stressors to native fish assemblages in southwestern rivers and streams are habitat alteration and introduction of non-native species. We present data that compare the fish assemblages in two desert rivers-the Gila and Verde (Arizona-New Mexico)-over a period of 7-12 years, respectively. We also present data on hydrographs, broadscale and local geomorphology, and past fisheries, water and land management activities. Peak flow mean volume of flow, variability of flow, canyon-bound and broad alluvial reaches, dams, and introduced fishes are all either directly or indirectly related to fish assemblages in southwestern rivers and streams. We suggest that three primary influencing factors-two natural and one human induced (hydrograph, geomorphology, management)-are critical features in delimiting native fish assemblages.

Fish,2006,"Rogowski, DL; Stockwell, CA",Parasites and salinity: costly tradeoffs in a threatened species,"Parasites and environmental conditions can have direct and indirect effects on individuals. We explore the relationship between salinity and parasites in an endemic New Mexico State threatened fish, the White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa). Spatial variation in salinity limits the distribution of the endemic springsnail (Juturnia tularosae) within Salt Creek, a small desert stream. The springsnail is the presumed intermediate host for trematodes that infect the White Sands pupfish, and trematode prevalence and intensity in pupfish are positively associated with the springsnail. Salinity and parasites both have negative impacts on pupfish, but in areas of high salinity, pupfish can effectively escape parasites. Pupfish trematodes were absent from sites lacking snails. At the upstream site, the absence of parasites and lower variance in salinity were correlated with larger pupfish that were in better condition than pupfish at either the middle or lower sites. Springsnails were present in the middle section, an area with moderate salinity, and all pupfish had trematodes (median abundance 847 trematodes/fish). Lipid levels and condition were lowest in fish from the middle site. Additionally, fewer older fish indicated an increased mortality rate. At the lower site, springsnails were absent due to high salinity; pupfish trematode abundance was much lower (six trematodes/fish), and fish condition was intermediate. An additional experiment revealed that snail activity and survival were significantly reduced at high salinities commonly present at the lower site. Although both high salinity and parasites significantly affect pupfish, parasites might be more detrimental.",OECOLOGIA,146,4,,615,622,,10.1007/s00442-005-0218-x,,,,,,0029-8549,,WOS:000234145300013

After the first rains, DOC content in stream water reached its maximum value (10-18 mg L(-1)), being explained by the leaching of deciduous leaves accumulated on the stream bed during drought. During this period, the largest molecules (> 10 kDa), were the most biodegradable, as indicated by high BDOC values measured during storm events and high enzymatic activities (especially for leucine-aminopeptidase). DOC > 100 kDa was strongly immobilized (78%) at the stream-riparian interface, whereas the smallest molecules (< 1 kDa) were highly mobile and accumulated in ground waters, indicating their greater recalcitrance. Differential enzymatic patterns between compartments showed a fast utilization of polysaccharides in the flowing water but a major protein utilization in the ground water. The results of the FI indicated a more terrestrial origin of the larger molecules in the flowing water, also suggesting that transformation of material occurs through the stream-riparian interface. Microbial immobilization and fast utilization of the most biodegradable fraction at the stream-riparian interface is suggested as a relevant DOC retention mechanism just after initial recharging of the ground water compartment. Large and rapid DOC inputs entering the intermittent river system during the transition from drought to precipitation provide available N and C sources for the heterotrophs. Heterotrophs efficiently utilize these resources that were in limited supply during the period of drought.

Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and seston, along with the standing crops of coarse benthic organic matter and fine benthic organic matter, were monitored monthly during 2002 in two reaches situated upstream and downstream of a waste water treatment plant effluent. Additionally, we examined two stream functional characteristics: whole stream metabolism, which was measured from diel changes in oxygen concentrations, and nutrient removal, which was Studied by experimental additions of NH4-N, NO3-N and PO4-P. The possible influence of WWTP organic matter alterations on ecosystem functioning was addressed by measuring epilithon characteristics (standing crop, C:N:P ratios and chlorophyll a content). The WWTP effluent caused an increase (several-fold) of DOC and seston concentrations, and FBOM standing crop. moreover it modified their temporal variation. Downstream of the wastewater treatment plant we detected an higher heterotrophic microbial biomass and a correspondent higher community respiration. The uptake of NH4-N, NO3-N and PO4-P was highly variable probably as consequence of the high variability of the compartments involved (e.g. DOC, FBOM, community respiration). We showed that WWTP effluent altered the organic matter dynamics of this Mediterranean-type headwater stream and that these effects were reflected in its ecosystem functioning. Because of the linkage of headwaters to downstream ecosystems and due to their significant role in landscape and catchment processes, the alterations of organic matter dynamics that we detected at a local scale may have important consequences on a broader scale.",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,42,2,,97,107,,10.1051/limn/2006014,,,,,,0003-4088,,WOS:000238798500005

Biogeochemistry,2006,"Sheldon, F.; Thoms, M. C.",In-channel geomorphic complexity: The key to the dynamics of organic matter in large dryland rivers?,"Large rivers are often considered to retain less organic material than smaller streams primarily because of a decrease in retentive structures. From our observations on the Barwon-Darling River, a semi-arid river in southeastem Australia, we suggest that geomorphic complexity plays a fundamental role in the retention of organic matter. The Barwon-Darling River has a 'complex' river channel cross-section with large inset benches being a prominent morphological feature within the channel. The importance of geomorphic complexity for retaining organic material is likely to be significant in dryland rivers. These rivers spend extended periods at low flow with infrequent large floods that inundate the floodplain. They do, however, experience more frequent within channel floods that inundate in-channel 'bench' features. In-channel geomorphic complexity and its ability to retain organic material, therefore, means that although the dominant lateral movements of organic material will still occur during large overbank flows, smaller 'pulse' inputs will occur with each in-channel rise and fall in water level. In dryland rivers, where large overbank flows may only occur every seven or more years, these small 'pulse' inputs of organic material may well be vital for the integrity of the system.This paper describes the contemporary complexity of a channel in a regulated and an unregulated reach of the Barwon-Darling and compares this with cross-sections surveyed in 1886. We show that flow regulation has greatly reduced channel complexity. We estimate the potential organic matter input to each bench level within the channel (using data collected under near natural riparian conditions) and measure the contemporary organic loads within the channel of the regulated and unregulated reach. This modelling suggests that the development of water resources has reduced the complexity of the channel in the regulated reach, resulting in a potential decrease in the retention of organic matter in this region of the river. The importance of this organic matter to the aquatic food web of the Barwon-Darling River is also demonstrated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Invertebrate,2006,"Sheldon, F; Thoms, MC",Relationships between flow variability and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition: Data from four Australian dryland rivers,"Australian dryland rivers have distinctive ecologies, intimately linked to their variable flows. The contrasting states of flood and drought mean that dryland rivers fluctuate between being highly connected (during floods: low fragmentation) to being highly disconnected (during droughts: high fragmentation) with the degree of connection between waterbodies on a spatial scale and the time since last connection on a temporal scale strongly influencing community composition. Flow regulation reduces the frequency and duration of flooding, thereby decreasing flow variability and imposing stable low flow conditions and high connectivity between waterbodies. Using macroinvertebrate assemblage data from four Australian dryland rivers (River Murray, Darling River, Cooper Creek and Diamantina River), we calculated various indices of flow variability from 30-year hydrographs and assessed how well long-term flow variability, and therefore variable levels of habitat connection, could explain broad patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Where hydrological connection between sites was strong (River Murray pool sites) there was extreme similarity between assemblages at each site. Also, for sites where hydrological disconnection was extreme there was similarity between assemblages. There were strong associations between the complex measures of flow variability and the assemblage composition of the four rivers, suggesting that flow variability, and therefore, variable levels of habitat connectivity, may be strong determinants of broad-scale assemblage composition in dryland rivers.

In arid landscapes, catchments are drained by a channel continuum that represents a potentially important driver of ecological pattern and process in the surrounding terrestrial environment. To better understand the role of drainage networks in arid landscapes, we determined how stream size influences the structure and productivity of riparian vegetation, and the accumulation of organic matter (OM) in soils beneath plants in an upper Sonoran Desert basin. Canopy volume of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina), as well as overall plant cover, increased along lateral upland-riparian gradients, and among riparian zones adjacent to increasingly larger streams. Foliar delta C-13 signatures for P. velutina suggested that landscape patterns in vegetation structure reflect increases in water availability along this arid stream continuum. Leaf litter and annual grass biomass production both increased with canopy volume, and total aboveground litter production ranged from 137 g m(-2) y(-1) in upland habitat to 446 g m(-2) y(-1) in the riparian zone of the perennial stream. OM accumulation in soils beneath P. velutina increased with canopy volume across a broad range of drainage sizes; however, in the riparian zone of larger streams, flooding further modified patterns of OM storage. Drainage networks represent important determinants of vegetation structure and function in upper Sonoran Desert basins, and the extent to which streams act as sources of plant-available water and/or agents of fluvial disturbance has implications for material storage in arid soils.",ECOSYSTEMS,9,3,,344,356,,10.1007/s10021-005-0167-6,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000237121600003

We applied an assessment model to the Conservation Area as a basis for monitoring long-term changes in riparian ecosystem condition resulting from changes in river water availability, and collected multi-year data on a subset of the most sensitive bioindicators. The assessment model is based on nine vegetation bioindicators that are sensitive to changes in surface water or ground water. Site index scores allow for placement into one of three condition classes, each reflecting particular ranges for site hydrology and vegetation structure. We collected the bioindicator data at 26 sites distributed among 14 reaches that had similar stream flow hydrology (spatial flow intermittency) and geomorphology (channel sinuosity, flood-plain width). Overall, 39% of the riparian corridor fell within condition class 3 (the wettest condition), 55% in condition class 2, and 6% in the driest condition class. Condition class 3 reaches have high cover of herbaceous wetland plants (e.g., Juncus and Schoenoplectus spp.) along the perennial stream channel and dense, multi-aged Populus-Salix woodlands in the flood plain, sustained by shallow ground water in the stream alluvium. In condition class 2, intermittent stream flows result in low cover of streamside wetland herbs, but Populus-Salix remain abundant in the flood plain. Perennial wetland plants are absent from condition class 1, reflecting highly intermittent stream flows; the flood plain is vegetated by Tamarix, a small tree that tolerates the deep and fluctuating ground water levels that typify this reach type.

In June 2006, however, the cases were remanded to the circuit court, leaving the status of intermittent streams uncertain once again. The presence of commercial species, such as coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), can be an important consideration when determining jurisdiction. These salmon spawn in the upper portions of Oregon coastal stream networks, where intermittent streams are common. In our study of a coastal Oregon watershed, we found that intermittent streams were an important source of coho salmon smolts. Residual pools in intermittent streams provided a means by which juvenile coho could survive during dry periods; smolts that overwintered in intermittent streams were larger than those from perennial streams. Movement of juvenile coho into intermittent tributaries from the mainstem was another way in which the fish exploited the habitat and illustrates the importance of maintaining accessibility for entire stream networks. Loss of intermittent stream habitat would have a negative effect on coho salmon populations in coastal drainages, including downstream navigable waters.",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,4,10,,513,518,,10.1890/1540-9295(2006)4[513:CSDOIS]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,1540-9295,,WOS:000242628600011
Assessment,2007,"Abellan, Pedro; Sanchez-Fernandez, David; Velasco, Josefa; Millan, Andres",Effectiveness of protected area networks in representing freshwater biodiversity: the case of a Mediterranean river basin (south-eastern Spain),"1. Biodiversity is probably at greater risk in freshwater systems than in other ecosystems. Although protected areas (PAS) play a vital role in the protection of biodiversity and are the mainstay of most conservation polices, the coverage of biodiversity by existing PA networks is often inadequate and few reserves are created that take into consideration freshwater biota.2. In this paper an attempt is made to address the performance of protected areas in the context of freshwater biodiversity conservation using data records for water beetles in a Mediterranean river basin.3. Although the present PAS in the study area cover a relatively high number of water beetle species, the distribution and extent of reserves is still inadequate or insufficient to protect freshwater biodiversity, especially species of conservation concern.4. Alternative area-selection methods (hotspots and complementary) were more efficient than PAs for representing water beetles. Within these, complementarity was the most efficient approach, and was able to represent all species in a significantly lower area than the current PA network. On the other hand, the future Natura 2000 Network will result in a great increase in the total area of protected land as well as in the biodiversity represented.5. Unfortunately, the occurrence of a species within a protected area is not a guarantee of long-term survival because the extent of PAS is often insufficient and disturbances occur outside park boundaries. Thus, whole-catchment management and natural-flow maintenance are indispensable strategies for freshwater biodiversity conservation.

Meteorological patterns influenced the organic matter dynamics of Fuirosos through 2 pathways: summer weather and flood pulses. Summer rains affected the timing of litter fall and the extent of flow intermittency, which gave rise to accumulations of organic matter in the streambed in dry years. With the onset of flow, these organic matter accumulations were the energy sources for considerable ecosystem respiration (similar to 30 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). Interflood periods punctuated by flood pulses determined cycles of steady accumulation and abrupt removal of stored organic matter. During the interflood periods, the efficiency of organic matter processing increased continuously. The seasonal changes in the riparian forest influenced the ecological consequences of the flood pulses. Resilience of the ecosystem, measured in terms of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, strongly depended on the supply of benthic organic matter and light availability, both of which were seasonally variable in the deciduous riparian forest.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,26,1,,54,69,,10.1899/0887-3593(2007)26[54:MARIOO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000243960700006

We review current watershed research and use a water-quality model to investigate headwater influences on downstream receiving waters. Our evaluations demonstrate the intrinsic connections of headwaters to landscape processes and downstream waters through their influence on the supply, transport, and fate of water and solutes in watersheds. Hydrological processes in headwater catchments control the recharge of subsurface water stores, flow paths, and residence times of water throughout landscapes. The dynamic coupling of hydrological and biogeochemical. processes in upland streams further controls the chemical form, timing, and longitudinal distances of solute transport to downstream waters. We apply the spatially explicit, mass-balance watershed model SPARROW to consider transport and transformations of water and nutrients throughout stream networks in the northeastern United States. We simulate fluxes of nitrogen, a primary nutrient that is a water-quality concern for acidification of streams and lakes and eutrophication of coastal waters, and refine the model structure to include literature observations of nitrogen removal in streams and lakes. We quantify nitrogen transport from headwaters to downstream navigable waters, where headwaters are defined within the model as first-order, perennial streams that include flow and nitrogen contributions from smaller, intermittent and ephemeral streams. We find that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70% of the mean-annual water volume and 65% of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams. Their contributions to mean water volume and nitrogen flux decline only marginally to about 55% and 40% in fourth- and higher-order rivers that include navigable waters and their tributaries.

The case of Majorca,"Insular streams suffer from similar forms of environmental degradation that occur in continental systems. However, the intrinsically fragile nature of insular ecosystems, together with their exceptional conservation value, makes them particularly vulnerable. Streams on the Mediterranean island of Majorca (Spain) dry annually during summer, with the period of flow permanence ranging from a few (two - three) to several (six - seven) months. Moreover, humans have greatly influenced the landscape of this island, reducing the extent and quality of the riparian vegetation. This study investigates the associations between natural flow variability, riparian land use and water quality with the structure of macroinvertebrate communities of temporary streams of the island of Majorca. Overall, the patterns of faunistic similarity showed that land use and flow permanence are decisive factors shaping the structure of the macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting these streams. Taxa richness was higher in undisturbed spring-fed sites, surrounded by Mediterranean climatic vegetation, than in disturbed sites, affected by urban or rural uses. However, abundance of macroinvertebrates was highest in the sites with a longer period of flow permanence, independent of land use. We also conclude that the springs feeding streams with a longer flow period represent a potential refuge for a high number of the endemic and relict species of macroinvertebrates, particularly those located in well-preserved areas. In fact, in spite of the insularity and the absence of permanent running waters, macroinvertebrate taxa richness in these spring-fed streams compared well to that in similar mainland streams. These results indicate that even though insular assemblages are more distinct than those in continental systems, the temporary streams existing on Majorca are not especially depauperate in terms of taxa richness.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,168,1,,55,70,,10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0055,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000245666500006

Proper management decisions for sustaining this biodiversity hotspot require understanding the hydrology of the riparian system and its interaction with the basin aquifer. To meet this need and to assess whether the techniques used would be efficient for evaluating other semiarid riparian ecosystems, we addressed the following questions. What are the contributions of different water sources (e. g., local recharge during monsoon flood events versus inflow of basin groundwater) to riparian groundwater and river baseflow? How does the spatial variability in water sources relate to gaining and losing reaches along of the river? We first characterize the possible water sources to the riparian system using a suite of geochemical tracers. Results indicate that, of the possible sources, basin groundwater recharged along the Huachuca Mountains to the west and local recharge of monsoon floodwaters are the dominant riparian water sources. Then, using their geochemical composition, we quantify these sources using a two end-member mixing model. We find that riparian groundwater composition varies between gaining and losing reaches. Locally recharged monsoon floodwater comprises 60 to 85% of riparian groundwater in losing reaches whereas that of gaining reaches contains only 10% to 40%. Baseflow, sampled year round, also contains a significant component of monsoon floodwater ranging from 80% on the upstream end and decreasing to 55% after passing though several gaining reaches. These results highlight the significance of local recharge during monsoon flood events as a water source for desert riparian systems, a fact that should be addressed when constructing and calibrating hydrologic models used to evaluate these future water management decisions.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,112,G3,,,,G03S02,10.1029/2006JG000263,,,,,,0148-0227,,WOS:000248286100001

J.; Wright, A.","Fish larvae, growth and biomass relationships in an Australian arid zone river: links between floodplains and waterholes","1. Floodplain inundation provides many benefits to fish assemblages of floodplain river systems, particularly those with a predictable annual flood pulse that drives yearly peaks in fish production. In arid-zone rivers, hydrological patterns are highly variable and the influence of irregular floods on fish production and floodplain energy subsidies may be less clear-cut. To investigate the importance of floodplain inundation to a dryland river fish assemblage, we sampled fish life stages on the floodplain of Cooper Creek, an Australian arid-zone river. Sampling was focused around Windorah during a major flood in January 2004 and in isolated waterholes in March 2004 following flood drawdown.2. Of the 12 native species known to occur in this region, 11 were present on the floodplain, and all were represented by at least two of three life-stages - larvae, juveniles or adult fish. Late stage larvae of six fish species were found on the floodplain. There were site-specific differences in larval species assemblages, individual species abundances and larval distribution patterns among floodplain sites.3. Significant growth was evident on the floodplain, particularly by larval and juvenile fish, reflecting the combination of high water temperatures and shallow, food rich habitats provided by the relatively flat floodplain.4. Low variation in biomass, species richness and presence/absence of juvenile and adult fish across four floodplain sites indicates consistently high fish productivity across an extensive area.5. Similarities and differences in fish biomass between the floodplain and isolated post-flood waterholes suggest high rates of biomass transfer (involving the most abundant species) into local waterholes and, potentially, biomass transfer by some species to other waterholes in the catchment during floodplain inundation and after floods recede.6. The high concentration of fish on this shallow floodplain suggests it could be a key area of high fish production that drives a significant proportion of waterhole productivity in the vicinity. The Windorah floodplain provides favourable conditions necessary for the spawning of some species and juvenile recruitment of the majority of species. It is also appears to be a significant conduit for the movements of fish that underpin high genetic similarity, hence population mixing, of many species throughout the Cooper Creek catchment. The high floodplain fish production in turn provides a significant energy subsidy to waterholes after floodwaters recede.7. The identification of key sites of high fish production, such as the Windorah floodplain, may be important from a conservation perspective. Key management principles should be: maintenance of the natural flooding regime; identification of the most productive floodplain areas; and maintenance of their connectivity to anastomosing river channels and the remnant aquatic habitats that ultimately sustain this fish assemblage through long-term dry/drought and flood cycles.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,12,,2385,2398,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01855.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000251026500006

Clearcut streams had been logged to the stream banks within 2 y prior to the start of our study. Adult aquatic insects were sampled from a 40-m reach at each study stream in 3 seasons: summer, autumn, and spring. Emergent insects were strong indicators of harvest condition and, regardless of flow duration or season, more aquatic insects emerged from streams in clearcut catchments than in forested catchments. Plecoptera had higher emergence rates from intermittent streams than from perennial streams in spring. Functional feeding group composition was not apparently affected by harvest condition or flow duration. Taxon richness was slightly higher at clearcut than at forested streams, primarily because of the occurrence of rare taxa at clearcut streams. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination of emergent aquatic insect assemblages showed community patterns that varied by season and harvest condition, but little by flow duration. Stream canopy % cover, stand age, logging debris (% slash), and substrate composition differed between clearcut and forested streams and were strongly correlated with NMS axes. Taxa that responded to conditions created by logging, such as % slash or canopy opening, contributed to differences in assemblages between headwater streams flowing through clearcut and forested catchments.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,26,4,,620,632,,10.1899/06-104.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000250645500004

Long-term studies in ecology are essential for understanding natural variability and in interpreting responses to disturbances and human perturbations. We assessed the long-term variability, stability and persistence of macroinvertebrate communities by analysing data from three regions in northern California with a mediterranean-climate. During the study period, precipitation either increased or decreased, and extreme drought events occurred in each region.2. Temporal trends in precipitation resulted in shifts from 'dry-year' communities, dominated by taxa adapted to no or low flow, to 'wet-year' communities dominated by taxa adapted to high flows. The abundance of chironomid larvae was an important driver of community change. Directional change in community composition occurred at all sites and was correlated with precipitation patterns, with more dramatic change occurring in smaller streams.3. All communities exhibited high to moderate persistence (defined by the presence/absence of a species) and moderate to low stability (defined by changes in abundance) over the study period. Stability and persistence were correlated with climatic variation (precipitation and El Nino Southern Oscillation) and stream size. Stability and persistence increased as a result of drought in small streams (first-order) but decreased in larger streams (second- and third-order). Communities from the dry season were less stable than those from the wet-season.4. This study demonstrates the importance of long-term studies in capturing the effects of and recovery from rare events, such as the prolonged and extreme droughts considered here.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,12,,2317,2339,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01859.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000251026500002
Assessment,2007,"Bernez, Ivan; Ferreira, Teresa",River macrophytes in regulated mediterranean-type rivers of southern Portugal,"River macrophytes are frequently studied at fundamental or applied levels, such as water quality assessment and management. Though some effects of river flow regulation on aquatic plants have been documented for temperate rivers, few studies have addressed regulation in Mediterranean-type rivers. We compared the flora from regulated sites and reference sites located upstream from southern Iberian reservoirs. Contrary to other situations, species richness downstream the reservoirs did not present an increase related to flow regulation. Species richness was relatively similar on sites located downstream from the dam and on reference sites, but variability among sites was smaller for the former. Furthermore, the sites closer to the dam were the driest and developed a floristic composition typical of intermittent rivers when the latter presented sufficient flow to develop an aquatic vegetation. In many cases, this water availability is related to the influence of the hydropeaking discharges located a few kilometres downstream from the dam.

N.","Associations of watershed vegetation and environmental variables with fish and crayfish assemblages in headwater streams of the Pedernales River, Texas","Intermittent headwater streams serve important functions for humans and wildlife in semi-arid rangelands. Increases in ashe juniper coverage in central Texas over recent decades are believed to have negatively impacted stream flows. Few studies have examined relationships between aquatic species and environmental factors in these systems as well as the influence of juniper coverage on assemblage structure. During summer 2003 and spring 2004, we examined species-environment relationships to infer potential effects of juniper cover on aquatic ecology relative to local-scale and watershed-scale environmental variables. Fish and crayfish species assemblages and physicochemical variables were investigated in spring-fed headwater tributaries of the Pedernales River, Texas. Fish abundance was much higher in summer 2003, whereas crayfish abundance was higher in spring 2004. Fish species richness was lower during spring 2004, possibly due to below average precipitation during spring 2004 that reduced deep-water refugia. Higher abundance of crayfish in spring 2004 samples was probably due to their ability to survive low-flow conditions, and a release from fish predation pressure. Fish assemblage structure was more strongly associated with local abiotic factors during spring 2004 when flow was reduced, whereas structure during summer 2003 samples suggested a relatively greater influence of predation. In general, juniper cover was weakly associated with fish and crayfish assemblages, although it tended to be positively associated with relatively high-quality habitat for sensitive taxa (flowing runs with coarse substrate; deep, connected pools). We suggest that intermediate levels of juniper cover in the region provide indirect benefits to aquatic organisms. However, short-term, local environmental factors appear to have a much greater influence than watershed vegetation on fish and crayfish assemblages in these intermittent streams.

Invertebrate,2007,"Bogan, Michael T.; Lytle, David A.",Seasonal flow variation allows 'time-sharing' by disparate aquatic insect communities in montane desert streams,"1. Flow variation can drive major abiotic changes in stream environments between seasons. Theoretically, disparate biotic communities could be maintained during different seasons at a single site if suitable refuges and colonist sources were available. Using isolated montane desert streams in south-east Arizona as a model system, we hypothesised that two disparate aquatic insect faunas (montane temperate and neotropical) could be maintained at the same sites through strong seasonal variation in abiotic conditions.2. We collected aquatic insects representing 59 families from seven streams during high-flow (March-April) and low-flow (June) sampling periods across two years. We assessed changes in aquatic insect community and functional feeding group composition by habitat (riffle, pool) and season (high flow, low flow).3. Within sites, wetted stream area decreased by an average of 97% between high-flow (predominately riffles) and low-flow (predominately pools) seasons. Community composition likewise showed strong seasonal patterns; the montane temperate fauna was strongly associated with the high-flow season while neotropical hemipterans and coleopterans were associated with the low-flow season. Increased water temperature was significantly associated with this shift from temperate to neotropical assemblages.4. Functional feeding group composition shifted dramatically by season. The proportion of predators increased from 24.5% (high flow) to 75.2% (low flow) while collector-filterers and shredders declined from 38.4% (high flow) to 1.7% (low flow).5. We suggest that habitat 'time-sharing' by disparate communities is facilitated via strong seasonal variation in temperature and flow and the presence of high elevation refuges or diapause stages for temperate montane taxa to survive the dry season.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,2,,290,304,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01691.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000243473600008
Invertebrate,2007,"Bonada, Nuria; Doledec, Sylvain; Statzner, Bernhard",Taxonomic and biological trait differences of stream macroinvertebrate communities between mediterranean and temperate regions: implications for future climatic scenarios,"Streams in mediterranean regions have highly seasonal discharge patterns, with predictable torrential floods and severe droughts. In contrast, discharge is less variable in temperate regions and intermittent flow conditions are uncommon. Hydroclimatic models predict that climate change would increase frequency and severity of floods and droughts across Europe, thus increasing the proportion of streams with mediterranean characteristics in actually temperate areas. Correspondingly, understanding actual ecological differences between mediterranean and temperate streams may help to anticipate large-scale ecological impacts of climate change. Given that large-scale factors determine local community composition, we hypothesized that climatic differences between mediterranean and temperate regions should affect the taxonomic and biological trait composition in streams. We assembled the abundance of stream macroinvertebrate genera of 265 sites each from the Mediterranean Basin and from temperate Europe and linked these abundances to published information on 61 categories of 11 biological traits reflecting the potential of resilience from and resistance to disturbances. Although regional taxonomic richness was higher in the mediterranean than in the temperate region, local taxonomic richness and diversity did not significantly differ between regions. Local trait richness and diversity were significantly higher in the mediterranean region. Both local taxonomic and trait-community composition differed between regions, but the former varied much more than the latter, highlighting that climate change could produce large changes in the taxonomic but rather weak changes in the trait composition. The mediterranean region was characterized by macroinvertebrates with higher dispersion and colonization capabilities, suggesting that species loss in the temperate region, by extinction or northward emigration of taxa, would be compensated for by immigration of southern mediterranean taxa. Thus, climate change would likely have stronger implications for the local conservation of taxa than for the trait composition of stream macroinvertebrate communities.",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,13,8,,1658,1671,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01375.x,,,,,,1354-1013; 1365-2486,,WOS:000248959400010
Invertebrate,2007,"Bonada, Nuria; Rieradevall, Maria; Prat, Narcis",Macroinvertebrate community structure and biological traits related to flow permanence in a Mediterranean river network,"In Mediterranean climate areas, the great seasonal variability in temperature and rainfall is considered to be an evolutionary pressure that constrains plant and animal communities and their biological traits. Droughts alter habitat availability (changes of flow alter riffle-pool sequences), although habitat characteristics may also exacerbate drought to some extent. Using a simple quantitative index based on the proportion of conglomerate bedrock versus gravel and cobbles, pools versus riffles and winter versus summer flow, we show how habitat characteristics (in terms of substratum and flow) may influence the permanency of a stream site and how flow permanence constrains macroinvertebrate community structure and biological traits. Annual and seasonal macroinvertebrate richness, and the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata, Coleoptera and Hemiptera) metrics differed between permanent, intermittent and ephemeral sites, but not between permanent and intermittent sites. In contrast, distinct biological traits were observed in the three flow categories, although permanent sites presented few significant traits which was attributed to the stability of the habitat. Intermittent sites were dominated by taxa with pool-like strategies, while ephemeral sites were characterized by fauna with life-history adaptations to floods and droughts. In contrast to most traits (e.g., dissemination, reproduction, substrate relation), which were more constrained by local flow and substrate characteristics, life-cycle characteristics did not differ significantly among flow categories. This pattern can be explained by the features of the Mediterranean climate and particularly its high seasonal predictability, which serves as a large-scale filter of life-cycle traits, independently of local hydromorphological characteristics. Our findings indicate that drought is related to habitat characteristics and that local habitat variability favours organisms with certain traits, while other traits are independent of habitat variability on this scale and are probably affected by other large-scale habitat characteristics.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,589,,,91,106,,10.1007/s10750-007-0723-5,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000248228300008

To characterize how this variability in discharge affects the concentration and flux of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen, we measured discharge and collected water samples in the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona from April 2001 through September 2002. Mean daily discharge during the study ranged from 2.5 x 10(3) m(3) day(-1) to 9.4 x 10(5) m(3) day(-1), with low discharge in late June followed shortly thereafter by the highest discharge in July or early August after the onset of monsoon storms. Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) dominated carbon and nitrogen flux during the nonmonsoon season, while Particulate Organic Matter (POM) dominated flux during the monsoon. The concentrations of Dissolved Organic Carbon and Nitrogen (DOC, DON), and NO(3)-N typically increased 2- to 10-fold, while POM increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude during the monsoon season. Concurrent increases in concentration and discharge resulted in 96% of the annual organic carbon (DOC + POC) and 97% annual nitrogen (DIN + DON + PON) flux occurring during the monsoon season with the majority of both organic carbon (92%) and total nitrogen (83%) being transported as particulates.

Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta(18)O values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five-to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta(18)O values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export.

Quantitative differences among headwater channels may offer an objective basis for prioritizing streamside protection. Here, we examine differences among headwater channels as potential transport corridors for debris flows. Specifically, we model differences among hill slopes and headwater channels in probabilities of initiating and being traversed by debris flows that deliver to fish-bearing channels. We develop an approach to rank these probabilities and apply the ranks in delineating alternative streamside management zones. Initiation and traversal probabilities are estimated from an empirically calibrated debris-flow model using regionally available 10-m digital elevation data. Alternatives are delineated by encompassing 25%, 50%, and 75% of debris-flow susceptible hill slopes and headwater channels. Highest initiation and traversal probabilities were contained in a relatively small percentage of the study area. Encompassing lower probabilities required disproportionately larger areas. Substituting delineated alternatives for currently prescribed headwater riparian management zones decreased the total area encompassed on federal lands but increased it on private and state lands. Our intent is not to advocate for any particular alternative but to demonstrate that knowledge about how headwater channels differ over large areas can help tailor riparian policies.",FOREST SCIENCE,53,2,,239,253,,,,,,,,0015-749X; 1938-3738,,WOS:000245514200011

Assessment,2007,"Capon, Samantha J.",Effects of flooding on seedling emergence from the soil seed bank of a large desert floodplain,"Australia's large desert floodplains are among the world's most hydrologically variable wetlands and vegetation in these habitats changes dramatically over time in response to flooding and drought. Annual forb and grass communities in these desert floodplains rely on large, diverse soil seed banks as critical sources of propagules for recruitment. I investigated the effects of flooding on seedling emergence from the soil seed bank of the Cooper Creek floodplain in and central Australia. My objective was to determine the effects of differences in both short-term flooding characteristics as well as the longer-term flood history of sediments on the composition of plant communities establishing from the soil seed bank. I conducted a greenhouse experiment in which sediments collected from high (inundated at least once every 1-5 yrs), medium (inundated approximately once in every 5-10 yrs), and low (inundated less than once a decade) flood frequency zones were subjected to different durations of submergence, rates of drawdown (i.e., duration of post-submergence waterlogging), and seasonal timing of flooding. The abundance of emerging seedlings more than doubled in response to longer overall durations of wetting, but the relative duration of submergence (i.e., 8 vs. 4 weeks) versus subsequent soil waterlogging (i.e., 4 vs. 8 weeks) within this period did not have a significant effect. The duration of submergence versus waterlogging did however influence the composition of emerging seedlings with almost twice as many annual monocots appearing following longer durations of submergence. All dominant species emerged frequently following both summer and winter flooding, suggesting opportunistic germination strategies. The composition of moderately abundant and rare species, however, differed in response to the seasonal timing of inundation with monocots more common following summer floods and forbs following winter flooding. Common species were well-distributed in the soil seed bank across the flood history gradient, and the species richness of emerging seedlings did not vary between different flood frequency zones. However, seedlings of species emerging from low flood frequency zone samples tended to be less abundant and differed in composition compared with those emerging from samples of high and medium flood frequency zones. My results suggest that changes to both short- and long-term flooding patterns, through flow management or climate change, are likely to affect vegetation responses to inundation in these desert floodplains. Reductions in flood pulse magnitude and frequency, for instance, could result in a decline in the abundance of valuable pasture grasses germinating in response to summer flooding and a loss of hydrophytic species in rarely flooded areas.",WETLANDS,27,4,,904,914,,10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[904:EOFOSE]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0277-5212,,WOS:000251471400013

The catchment includes two first-order streams and their second-order confluence. Six reaches were selected for study based on differences in channel slope and habitat cover (bedrock, riffle/run, debris dam and pool). Stream water in each reach was acidic and oligotrophic.2. The study reaches had different degrees of channel drying. In the first-order reaches, surface flow ceased earlier in the season and for longer periods than second-order reaches. Regardless of reach, pool and debris dam habitats retained water longer than riffle/runs and bedrock. Unlike other habitats, debris dams retained moisture for relatively long periods following cessation of surface flow.3. Reach-specific macroinvertebrate production ranged from approximately 1.7 to 2.9 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1) which are among the lowest values ever reported. Habitat-specific production ranged from approximately 0.5 to 5.0 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1) (bedrock and debris dams, respectively).4. At the reach scale, quantities of stored benthic organic matter (range approximately 200-600 g AFDM(-2)) decreased in a downstream direction.5.

Although not yet studied in the field, the distribution and abundance of Andalusian toothcarp are thought to be strongly influenced by interspecific interactions. We analysed the abundance and microhabitat use of Andalusian toothcarp in two water courses, one in which several other fish species occurred (sympatric site) and one hypersaline stream in which toothcarp was the only species present (allopatric site). Fish were sampled using plastic minnow traps and results were analysed separately for three size categories. Toothcarps were clearly more abundant in the allopatric population than in the sympatric one, though the difference was less apparent in the smallest size category. In coexistence with other species, toothcarp occupied shallower microhabitats, but in both sites in the absence of shelter fish selected deeper positions than in its absence. While in the sympatric site sheltered microhabitats were used predominately by small individuals, in the allopatric ones they were used by larger ones. Observed patterns strongly suggest that predation is the main mechanism involved in the differences in abundance and microhabitat use between sites.

We assessed subsurface habitats and associated biota in a 435-m reach of a first-order, intermittent stream draining a riparian zone dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in north central Massachusetts. Stream flow was found only in subsurface flowpaths beneath large boulders and surface root mats over approximately 70% of the total stream length at summer base flow. Temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations of subsurface water were similar to surface water. Macroinvertebrates were found in subsurface habitats but at a lower abundance and richness per unit area compared to surface habitats. Collectors such as Chironomidae, Polycentropodidae, and Ephemerellidae were generally the most abundant families in both surface and subsurface habitats. Our findings indicate that in some glaciated watersheds, intermittent streams with no visual evidence of surface flow may contain subsurface flowpaths with water chemistry and biota comparable to coupled perennial surface flow reaches.

Significant faecal contamination arises through the deposition of faeces by grazing animals directly into waterways in New Zealand. Bridging of streams intersected by farm raceways is an appropriate mitigation measure to prevent direct deposition during herd crossings, whilst fencing stream banks will prevent access from pasture into waterways by cattle that are characteristically attracted to water. Riparian buffer strips not only prevent cattle access to waterways, they also entrap microbes from cattle and other animals being washed down-slope towards the stream in surface runoff. Microbial water quality improvements can be realised by fencing stock from ephemeral streams, wetlands, seeps, and riparian paddocks that are prone to saturation. Soil type is a key factor in the transfer of faecal microbes to waterways. The avoidance of, or a reduction in, grazing and irrigation upon poorly drained soils characterised by high bypass flow and/or the generation of surface runoff, are expected to improve microbial water quality. Dairyshed wastewater should be irrigated onto land only when the water storage capacity of the soil will not be exceeded. This ""deferred irrigation"" can markedly reduce pollutant transfer to waterways, particularly that via subsurface drains and groundwater. Advanced pond systems provide excellent effluent quality and have particular application where soil type and/or climate are unfavourable for irrigation. Research needs are indicated to reduce faecal contamination of waters by livestock.",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,50,2,,267,278,,,,,,,,0028-8233,,WOS:000248244800011
Invertebrate,2007,"Datry, Thibault; Larned, Scott T.; Scarsbrook, Mike R.",Responses of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages to large-scale variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange,"1. Flow permanence (the proportion of time that flowing water is present) strongly influences benthic invertebrate assemblages in ephemeral and intermittent river reaches. Effects of varying flow permanence on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages are not well understood, and have not previously been studied at large spatial scales.2. We used a 52-km long flow-permanence gradient in the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand to assess hyporheic assemblage responses to variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange. The Selwyn mainstem consists of perennial and temporary reaches embedded in longer downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections.3. We predicted that hyporheic invertebrate diversity, density and assemblage stability would increase with increasing flow permanence. We further predicted that assemblage structure would be influenced by the relative contribution of downwelling and upwelling water at the reach-scale.4. Hyporheic invertebrates were collected at 15 river cross-sections over a 13-month period. As predicted, hyporheic taxon richness, density and assemblage stability varied directly with flow permanence. The distribution of taxa along the flow permanence gradient appeared to be related to desiccation resistance. However, it is possible that proximity to colonist sources also contributed to distribution patterns.5. Taxon richness was significantly higher at sites in the gaining section compared with the losing section. Sites with high flow permanence in the gaining and losing sections supported distinct hyporheic assemblages, characterised by amphipods and isopods in the gaining section, and ostracods, Hydra sp. and the mayfly Deleatidium spp. in the losing section.6. Results of the study suggest an expansion of the scope of the Hyporheic Corridor Concept to include large hyporheic flowpaths associated with unbounded alluvial plains rivers. Hyporheic assemblages in alluvial rivers are strongly influenced by large-scale flow permanence gradients, large-scale surface water-groundwater exchange, and their interactions.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,8,,1452,1462,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01775.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000247905900004
Fish,2007,"Davey, Andrew J. H.; Kelly, David J.",Fish community responses to drying disturbances in an intermittent stream: a landscape perspective,"1. Refugia are critical to the persistence of individuals, populations and communities in disturbed environments, yet few studies have considered how the position of refugia within the landscape interacts with the behavioural responses of component species to determine the influence of disturbance events on mobile animals.2. An 18-month quantitative electrofishing survey was undertaken on the Selwyn River, a stream that is intermittent in its middle reaches, to determine how the direction and distance to refugia affect the response of fish populations to drying, and how landscape context interacts with flow permanence to produce spatial patterns in communities.3. Overall, the propensity of fish to take refuge in perennial reaches during drying episodes, and the rate and extent of recolonization from these refugia upon rewetting, depended upon the direction and distance to refugia and the behaviour of component species.4. In the upper river, Canterbury galaxias (Galaxias vulgaris), upland bullies (Gobiomorphus breviceps) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) migrated upstream to permanent water as the stream dried from the bottom up, but frequent drying and slow recolonization by most species combined to produce a fish community in intermittent reaches that was quantitatively and qualitatively different to that in neighbouring perennial reaches.5. In the lower river, fish did not appear to migrate downstream to permanent water as the stream dried from the top down, but a lower frequency of drying episodes and faster recolonization by upland bullies and eels (Anguilla spp.) from downstream refugia allowed the fish community in intermittent reaches to converge with that in neighbouring perennial reaches during prolonged wetted periods.6. Longitudinal patterns of increasing fish density and species richness with flow permanence are interpreted as the product of species-specific responses to drying events and the spatial position of refugia within the riverscape.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,9,,1719,1733,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01800.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000248960100007

We combined a conservative tracer addition with measurements of water table elevation and nutrient concentrations of surface and subsurface water to examine hydrologic interactions among surface and subsurface subsystems and their implications for stream biogeochemistry. We injected bromide ( Br-) into a 400- m reach of Sycamore Creek, a losing stream in central Arizona, for 15 d and monitored changes in concentration in three subsystems: surface, parafluvial, and riparian zones. Additionally, we collected water samples from these subsystems for nutrient analyses. Water flowed from surface to subsurface zones as expected in this losing stream, but a significant amount of subsurface water ( 17% of surface discharge in the reach) returned to the surface. Within the parafluvial subsystem, median transport time (T-med) in two gravel bars differed substantially ( from 2 to 30 h and from 6 to > 300 h, respectively, for upper and lower bars), and varied significantly with depth in the lower bar ( mean ( +/- se) Tmed = 190 +/- 20 h at 30 cm compared to 101 +/- 18 h at 110 cm). Flow paths from the surface to parafluvial and riparian zones, and subsequently back to the surface stream, differ from patterns in mesic areas, where water moves laterally and vertically towards the surface stream. Estimates of nutrient retention for the stream reach varied four fold in response to simulated changes in lateral subsurface connections and the configuration of subsystems.

Assessment,2007,"El Gamri, Tarig; Saeed, Amir B.; Abdalla, Abdalla K.",Prediction of Wadi Discharge in East-Central Sudan and its Impacts on Water Resources Management,"Seasonal streams (wadis) are of vital importance in dry and semidry countries including Sudan. Depending on rainfall variability, the annual discharge of such wadis was estimated to range from 3 to 7 km(3) per annum. In the present study two wadi - discharge prediction methodologies were used to predict the discharge of Khor (wadi) Abu Fargha. The first methodology depends on the ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event which was divided into six distinct stages. The discharge during each stage was compared to previously estimated rainfall in the dry zone of the Sudan during the concurrent stage. The methodology was found to illustrate about 83% of the discharge behaviour of Khor Abu Fargha. This high prediction skill is attributed to the fact that the wadi is located in an area that is influenced by the ENSO event and to the availability of the discharge data for consecutive 34 years. The use of global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in rainfall seasonal forecast studies was initiated during the 1990s through the, development of empirical - statistical models. Using such methodology the models predicting Abu Fargha discharges were found to excel those for some meteorological stations and the dry zone of the Sudan as well. This is attributed to the fact that wadi discharges represent the whole catchment area whereas rainfall data represent only the rain gauge readings. The models using May global SSTs achieved better predictability in Abu Fargha discharges the thing which was found to be consistent with the results obtained in previous studies by Kassala meteorological station which is located in the vicinity of the wadi. The paper illustrates the use of the wadi - prediction information in forecasting the available storage of the aquifers and concluded that combining the different information, realistic management of surface and ground water resources can be achieved.

Those in Australia are characterised by long periods of no flow in which they persist for many months as series of isolated, often turbid, waterholes. We assessed benthic and pelagic primary production, respiration, and bacterial production in one of these waterholes to determine the metabolic balance of the waterhole and resolve the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic carbon. Despite a photic zone depth of only 0.25 m, three lines of evidence suggested that autochthonous sources of organic carbon were important for fuelling bacterial production under no-flow conditions: the metabolic balance of the waterhole was not indicative of large allochthonous inputs; rates of gross primary production were great enough to meet a substantial fraction of estimated bacterial carbon demand; and pathways for allochthonous carbon to enter the waterhole were limited. These results suggest that models of lake metabolism based on temperate ecosystems can be expanded to include dryland river waterholes, which group with eutrophic lakes owing to their high levels of inorganic nutrients, low allochthonous inputs and autotrophic metabolic balance.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,58,3,,250,262,,10.1071/MF06142,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000245207700003

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the length of the drought periods on macroinvertebrate assemblages. We collected invertebrates in four reaches of the Po river, characterised by different periods of absence of surface water. We found significant differences among the stations in invertebrate abundance and taxa richness, with a decrease in the more drought-affected stream reaches. Collector-gatherers significantly increased as the drought period lengthened, while the opposite occurred for scrapers and shredders. The areas with a discontinuous presence of water were mainly colonised by small, fast-growing, plurivoltine organisms. A main result of our study is that only a few taxa appear to be able to survive in reaches with intermittent flow, underlining the great ecological difference between perennial and naturally intermittent streams.

A data set from Mediterranean France, Iberia and Greece (similar to 2000 sites) was used to describe the characteristics of fish assemblages, explore their responses to anthropogenic disturbance and analyse the implications for river quality assessment. There was a southwards decline in species richness per site, but endemicity and proportion of alien species increased. Sites in the eastern Mediterranean had higher endemicity, lower site richness and lower number of alien species than sites in western Mediterranean Europe. Assemblage composition differed between Mediterranean sub-regions, but was dominated by three major fish types: a salmonid fish type common throughout the study area and two cyprinid-dominated fish types (in some sub-regions, Salmo trutta L. is present but not numerically dominant), corresponding to a gradient in hydrological and temperature regimes. Metric responses to perturbation were compared with those found at the European (larger scale) and basin (smaller scale) levels. Overall metric response was weaker in this Mediterranean application. The best responses to human pressure were usually obtained with abundance-based metrics and included the contribution of naturalised alien species.

Assessment,2007,"Herron, N. F.; Croke, B. F. W.",Including the Influence of Groundwater Exchanges in a Lumped Rainfall-Runoff Model,"Traditionally, surface and ground water resources have been managed as separate resources in Australia, with the result that interactions between the two components have not been duly considered in the development of management strategies. A more integrated approach is required to evaluate the impacts of groundwater extraction on streamflow regime, and eliminate the potential for over-allocation of resources due to double-accounting of the available resource. Models, which represent the exchanges of water between surface and ground water systems, are needed to inform integrated water resource management.In this paper, the IHACRES_GW model developed by Ivkovic et al. (2005a) and Ivkovic (2006) has been coupled with the catchment moisture deficit (CMD) version of the IHACRES non-linear module (Croke and Jakeman, 2004). The question posed is what kind of non-linear model structure is required that will permit the use of climate data to explore ephemeral stream behaviour and the impacts of groundwater extractions on flow regime.Results from running the coupled model with Ivkovic's (2006) parameters and a partially-calibrated CMD model (GW_CMD in Figure 1) show that although the coupled model reproduces total streamflow over the simulation period well, the flow regime is poorly represented (Figure 1). The observed flow record has fewer quickflow events, but with typically higher streamflow peaks and a much greater proportion of 'no flow' periods than the modelled streamflow. These results identified a need to modify the model and/or vary model parameter values in order to improve model performance. Here we focus on changing the CMD module, and leave the GW parameters unchanged.Sensitivity testing of the stress threshold parameter (f) shows it to have a significant impact on model performance, through its influence on the total water balance and the position of the groundwater table. The introduction of an effective rainfall threshold (K) for varying the parameters (v(s) and v(q)) that govern the partitioning of effective rainfall between slow and quick flow pathways significantly impacts the number of quickflow events, but at the expense of baseflow estimation. Figure 1 shows improvements in the representation of flow ephemerality when f=1.2 and K=0.1, but these changes do not go far enough.[GRAPHICS]A full calibration of the model should produce a set of parameter values that will provide a better prediction of streamflow behaviour and baseflow contributions over time, but Ivkovic's (2006) experience suggests that other changes might be necessary and more effective in improving model calibration and performance. These include exploring alternative methods for deriving a catchment-averaged rainfall time-series, and breaking Coxs Creek catchment into sub-catchments and calibrating them each individually. Both of these methods will increase the representation of spatial variability, which is not necessarily achieved very well using a single set of parameter values.","MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY",,,,1436,1442,,,,International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07),"DEC 10-13, 2007",Lincoln Univ; HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd; Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ); Univ Canterbury; SGI; Lincoln Ventures Ltd; Hoare Res Software Ltd; IMACS; IEMSS; Environm Modelling & Software; IBM,"Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND",,978-0-9758400-4-7,WOS:000290030701072

It is also needed in order to conform to requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. Monitoring in such regions sets particular challenges. This paper explains a system of low-cost monitoring of changes in morphology, vegetation and sediment cover in channels and valley floors of ephemerally flowing streams. It has been applied in SE Spain for 10 years and has proved very effective. In particular, the use of simple crest-stage recorders for measuring flow height and the use of real-time differential GPS for rapid and accurate survey and for relocating points have proved very valuable. Part of the monitoring is focused on the interaction of plants and channel processes. Small changes in and around vegetation associated with flow events have been detected by a combination of quadrat surveys and cross-profiling of the channel. A range of flow events has been measured over the period of monitoring, demonstrating their differing effects and the varying sensitivity and responsiveness of different sites. The sporadic occurrence of flood events in such an environment means that a strategy of monitoring several sites and of continuation over many years has great benefits.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,127,41699,,445,457,,10.1007/s10661-006-9294-6,,,,,,0167-6369,,WOS:000244687000040

Semiarid savannas exhibit sharp seasonality, complex hillslope hydrology and high spatial heterogeneity, all of which ultimately impact nutrient fluxes between riparian, upland and aquatic environments. Our review shows that strong environmental drivers such as fire and herbivory enhance nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment transport to lower slope positions by shaping vegetative patterns. These vectors differ significantly from other and and semiarid ecosystems, and from mesic ecosystems where the impact of fire and herbivory are less pronounced and less predictable. Also unique is the presence of sodic soils in certain hillslopes, which substantially alters hydrological flowpaths and may act as a trap where nitrogen is immobilized while sediment and phosphorus transport is enhanced. Nutrients and sediments are also deposited in the riparian zone during seasonal, intermittent floods while, during the dry season, subsurface movement of water from the stream into riparian soils and vegetation further enrich riparian zones with nutrients. As is found in mesic ecosystems, nutrients are immobilized in semiarid riparian corridors through microbial and plant uptake, whereas dissimilatory processes such as denitrification may be important where labile nitrogen and carbon are in adequate supply and physical conditions are suitable-such as in seeps, wallows created by animals, ephemeral wetlands and stream edges. Interaction between temporal hydrologic connectivity and spatial heterogeneity are disrupted by disturbances such as large floods and extended droughts, which may convert certain riparian patches from sinks to sources for nitrogen and phosphorus. In the face of increasing anthropogenic pressure, the scientific challenges are to provide a basic understanding of riparian biogeochemistry in semiarid African savannas to adequately address the temporal and spatial impact of disturbances, and to apply this knowledge to better regional land and water management.

Invertebrate,2007,"Jenkins, K. M.; Boulton, A. J.",Detecting impacts and setting restoration targets in arid-zone rivers: aquatic micro-invertebrate responses to reduced floodplain inundation,"1. Water extraction from arid-zone rivers increases the time between floods across their floodplain wetlands. Less frequent flooding in Australian arid-zone rivers has impaired waterbird and fish breeding, killed riparian vegetation and diminished invertebrate and macrophyte communities. Restoration currently focuses on reinstating floods to rejuvenate floodplain wetlands, yet indicators to measure the success of this are poorly developed.2. We explored the application of criteria for ecologically successful river restoration to potential restoration of floodplain wetlands on the Darling River, arid-zone Australia. Using emergence of micro-invertebrates from resting eggs as an indicator, we compared responses of taxa richness, densities and community composition in floodplain lakes with different inundation histories.3. Increased drying of floodplain lakes reduced the number of micro-invertebrate taxa. Several key taxa were absent and faunal densities (particularly cladocerans) were reduced when the duration of drying increased from 6 to 20 years.4. A conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which restoration of flooding regime could achieve the target of preserving micro-invertebrate community resilience predicts that reducing the dry period between floods will minimize losses of viable resting eggs. Protection of this 'egg bank' permits a boom in micro-invertebrates after flooding, promoting successful recruitment by native fish and waterbirds.5. Synthesis and applications. In arid-zone rivers, micro-invertebrate densities and community composition are useful indicators of the impact of reduced flooding as a result of water extraction. Critical to successful native fish recruitment as their first feed and as prey for waterbirds, micro-invertebrates are a potential early indicator of responses by higher trophic levels. Taxon richness, density and key taxa present after flooding, all indicators of resilience, can be incorporated into targets for arid-zone river restoration. For example, one restoration target may be microcrustacean densities between 100 and 1000 L-1 within 2-3 weeks after spring flooding. These criteria can be applied to measure the ecological success of restoration projects seeking to recover natural flood regimes. Given the high economic cost of water in arid zones, convincing demonstrations of the ecological success of environmental water allocations are crucial.",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,44,4,,823,832,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01298.x,,,,,,0021-8901,,WOS:000247667100012

The Pecos River is a medium-sized, sand-bed river with a highly variable hydrograph and some reaches characterized by historic and recent periods of flow intermittency. Fish habitat was described in four reaches at flows of 0.05-2.29 m(3)/s by means of a simultaneous, coordinated program of channel topographic surveys, mesohabitat mapping, fish sampling, and measurement of microhabitat and chemical parameters. We determined that fish habitat in this sand-bed river was effectively described at the mesohabitat scale. Furthermore, mesohabitats were visually distinguishable and separable by means of hydraulic and geomorphic parameters and the relationship between flow and depth, velocity, and velocity: depth ratios. The eight cyprinid species in the Pecos River primarily used four mesohabitat types that were consistently available at the full range of flows examined, including perpendicular and parallel plunges, backwaters, and slackwaters. In winter, five species (red shiner Cyprinella lutrensis, plains killifish Fundulus zebrinus, plains minnow Hybognathus placitus, Arkansas River shiner N. girardi, and sand shiner N. stramineus) shifted to backwaters, where water temperatures were relatively warmer than those of the main channel. Runs, flats, and riffles were generally the most available mesohabitat types, but their availability changed with flow; only four species (red shiner, plains killifish, speckled chub Macrhybopsis aestivalis, and sand shiner) selected these types, and they did so infrequently in summer. The Pecos bluntnose shiner was a habitat specialist that selected primarily rare plunge pools at sandbar faces, whereas species such as the red shiner were habitat generalists that used a variety of mesohabitat types. We found that a range of base flows sustained the preferred habitats of the eight cyprinid species and that no single flow maximized this preferred habitat because of a scaling effect of flow on sand bedforms.",NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,27,3,,750,764,,10.1577/M06-016.1,,,,,,0275-5947,,WOS:000249158900003
Assessment,2007,"Khan, Shahbaz; Ahmad, Aftab; Saeed, Zahid",Ocean Based Statistical Forecasts for Seasonal Irrigation Allocations,"The initial general security water allocation announcements for water users in the New South Wales (NSW) part of the Murray Valley are made during July. The initial water allocation announcement is very conservative as the allocations are based on storage levels and historical minimum inflows statistics to dams during the irrigation seasons. There is a good chance that the water allocations will be increased as the season proceeds. Water availability during the cropping season is a major factor influencing planting decisions made by irrigators and can have a major bearing on the financial viability and irrigation efficiency of irrigation areas. Therefore, increased knowledge on the likely end-of-season allocation by advance predictions can assist in minimising cropping risk and can help optimise farm returns and achieve better irrigation efficiencies.Seasonal river flow forecasts are used for determining anticipated water allocations; however, this paper presents a more direct approach that forecasts water allocation instead of river flow. The study is based on the hypothesis that the sea-surface temperature (SST) and ocean based climate variability indices (CVIs) are statistically related to water allocation forecasts in a river catchment. Over 100-years data on a global two degree grid SST, CVIs, and water allocations in the Murray Irrigation Area (MIA) were analysed. Statistical techniques including probability analysis and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used to determine the underlying relationships among predictor variables and the end-of-irrigation-season water allocation (February allocation) in the MIA. The SST at three locations around the continent; one lying in the equatorial Pacific, second in the Indian Ocean and third in the Tasmanian Sea, were found highly correlated (Pearson Correlation Coefficient up to -0.83) with February allocation levels in the MIA based on analysis using the CSIRO's SSTman software.The significant variables identified by the MLR analyses include; SST, SOI, mean sea level pressure, start-of-season (August) and mid-of-season (October) announced allocations and the risk factor. The risk factor can be varied from 0 to 100% and relates the probability of February allocation to announced August allocation and translates degree of risk farmer may take based on known August allocation. The value of the risk factor must be chosen with care because if user/farmer decides a higher value of risk factor, the model will forecast higher allocation suggesting farmer to grow more crops but at the same time involve a higher degree of risk of actually not getting that level of allocation. The model was validated against actual announced allocations for the month of February for ten years (1996/97 to 2005/06). The validation results are presented in Figure 1A. The model underestimated allocations for the years 2001 and 2002. This may be due to borrowing water from future years despite exceptionally low rainfalls during the season and not taking into account then emerging drought conditions.[GRAPHICS]A simple software tool developed based on the findings of this study will provide farmers with risk based crop management options.","MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY",,,,619,625,,,,International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07),"DEC 10-13, 2007",Lincoln Univ; HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd; Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ); Univ Canterbury; SGI; Lincoln Ventures Ltd; Hoare Res Software Ltd; IMACS; IEMSS; Environm Modelling & Software; IBM,"Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND",,978-0-9758400-4-7,WOS:000290030700093

The forms and rates of responses by aquatic invertebrates and sediment microbes to inundation depend on desiccation resistance during preceding dry periods. We assessed invertebrate and microbial responses to inundation over a range of preceding dry periods in an ephemeral reach of the Selwyn River, New Zealand. Microbial response variables were dissolved oxygen consumption and non-specific esterase activity. Sampling sites along the reach had been continuously dry for 1-592 d prior to sample collection. The onset of flow simulated by an experimental inundation led to the appearance of aquatic invertebrates in all samples, but the assemblages varied with the length of the preceding dry period. Taxon richness decreased linearly with dry period length while density decreased exponentially. These patterns indicate that a large number of individuals from desiccation-sensitive taxa were eliminated soon after flow ceased, and a low-density assemblage composed of a small number of desiccation-resistant taxa persisted during prolonged dry periods. As with invertebrate density, sediment respiration and nonspecific esterase activity decreased with length of dry period, and were characterized by exponential decay functions. The results of the inundation experiments suggest that a temporal ecotone exists for about one week after the disappearance of flowing water, and before the terrestrial system stabilizes.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,69,4,,554,567,,10.1007/s00027-007-0930-1,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000251878800012
Biogeochemistry,2007,"Lewis, David Bruce; Grimm, Nancy B.",Hierarchical regulation of nitrogen export from urban catchments: Interactions of storms and landscapes,"In urban catchments of arid central Arizona, we investigate how the export of mineral and organic nitrogen (N) in storm runoff is regulated by interactions between local landscape characteristics and broader scale storm features. First, we test whether N export is more a function of (1) processes that affect N concentration in runoff or (2) the propensity of the catchment to convey rainfall as runoff. With data pooled across catchments, the mass of N in export (load) is determined by processes regulating runoff N concentration. There are exceptions when catchments are examined individually, where N load from some catchments is determined by the hydrologic responsiveness of the catchment. Second, we investigate the relationship between N export and catchment features. Loads per catchment area were greater from more impervious catchments, probably because impervious catchments held more N in a mobilizable phase and conveyed more rainfall as overland flow. Loads per area were lower from larger catchments, possibly owing to more N-retention hot spots in larger catchments. Catchments with the greatest N exports were those with commercial land use, and loads decreased as development became less prevalent or as residential replaced industrial land use. Third, we investigated how catchment features moderated direct responses of N export to storms. Export was less correlated with storm features in catchments that were larger, more pervious, and less industrial. Results support an ""N build and flush'' hypothesis, which purports that there is little biotic processing of N deposited to arid, urban surfaces with little organic matter. The rate and duration of deposition determine the size of the mobile N pool. Any amount of rainfall capable of generating overland flow would entrain nearly all mobilizable N and export it from the catchment. Nonetheless, these results suggest that, even with daunting seasonal and interannual variability in storm conditions, material export can be reduced by managing intrinsic catchment features.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,17,8,,2347,2364,,10.1890/06-0031.1,,,,,,1051-0761,,WOS:000251739800018

Fluvial ecosystems are thus important environments for understanding spatial variability in nutrient concentrations. At the San Pedro River in semi-arid Arizona, USA, we investigated how variability in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was regulated by subsystem type and hydrological flowpaths. The three subsystems we compared were the riparian zone, parafluvial (gravel bar) zone, and surface stream. DIN concentration was greater in the riparian zone than in the surface stream, suggesting that the riparian zone retains DIN and is a source of N for the surface stream. Parafluvial zones were too variable to generalize how they regulate DIN. Our hypothesis that subsystem type regulates DIN oxidation was too simple. The riparian and parafluvial zones host a mosaic of oxidizing and reducing conditions, as they exhibited highly variable ammonium to nitrate (NH4+:NO3-) ratios. Surface stream DIN was dominated by NO3-. Along a subsurface flowpath in the riparian zone, we did not observe spatial covariation among the N forms and transformations involved in mineralization. We also compared spatial variability in solute concentrations between flowpaths and non-flowpath reference areas. Our mixed results suggest that spatial variability is regulated in part by flowpaths, but also by solute-specific processing length along a flowpath. To understand the distribution of N in fluvial ecosystems, subsystem type and flowpaths are readily discernable guides, but they should be coupled with other mechanistic factors such as biota and soil type.",LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,22,6,,911,924,,10.1007/s10980-007-9078-6,,,,,,0921-2973,,WOS:000247386600009

The goal of our study was to assess the nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in channel-bed processes of temporary streams between floods. Results show that, during winter, temperatures ranged between 9.5 and 11.2 degrees C and oxygen concentration ranged from 8.0 to 9.5mg L-1, whereas, during summer, temperatures varied between 21.2 and 26.8 degrees C and oxygen between 1.2 and 5.3 mg L-1, with oxygen depletion in the pools during the night. The nitrate concentrations were far more abundant during winter (February), while ammonium concentration increased after stream fragmentation into pools (especially in July when oxygen depletion conditions favoured ammonification). Results on sediment profiles showed that the most active sediment layers for NH4-N are the top 2-3 cm, corresponding to the sediment depositional sites of the stream. Phosphate concentrations had larger variability, yet concentrations decreased from winter to spring and increased again in summer, when the shallow water pools were formed. Sediment profiles at the sediment depositional sites showed that P0O(4)-P was more dynamic in the first 6 cm.In Mediterranean temporary streams, nutrient dynamics vary seasonally, as the system transits from lotic conditions to shallow lentic conditions, evidencing the regeneration of nutrients from organic and inorganic matter during the flow cessation period.

We used controlled, replicated experiments to quantify the use of rainfall cues for flood escape in seven common desert stream insects. The hemipterans Curicta pronotata and Aquarius remigis responded consistently to rainfall cues by crawling vertically away from the water, in such a way that they may escape flash floods in nature. The coleopteran Gyrinus plicifer showed no response to rainfall cues. The hemipteran Ambrysus woodburyi did not exit the water but sought refuge under submerged rocks. Three taxa (Ranatra quadridentata, Corydalus texanus, and Rhantus atricolor) gave ambiguous results, although the latter apparently responded to environmental cues other than rainfall.

This study analysed changes occurring in Mediterranean stream fish assemblages over a sequence of dry years followed by a generally wet period (1991-98). Variations in assemblage attributes were quantified at the basin and stream reach scales, and related to variables reflecting the occurrence of unusually dry or wet conditions.2. Assemblage variability increased along with the resolution of analysis, with little changes in species richness, composition and rank abundances, but significant variation in individual species abundances. Fluctuations in relative abundances were significantly affected by variables reflecting the severity of summer droughts and the occurrence of rainy springs. These patterns were evident at the basin scale, while variability at individual stream reaches tended to be higher and less related to rainfall patterns.3. At least three response guilds to rainfall variation could be identified: two of the four abundant and widespread species (chub and loach) declined following dry years, whereas the two other core species (nase and eel) declined after rainy spring; one scarce native species (stickleback) increased in dry years.4. Except at the two most upstream reaches, the assemblages tended to recover quickly to previous configuration after the changes occurring during the sequence of dry years.5. Temporal variability of local assemblages was concordant among reaches but did not follow any consistent spatial pattern. Instead, spatial patterns in assemblage attributes changed over time in response to environmental variability, with a tendency for a disruption of upstream-downstream gradients following dry years.6. Results supported the view that present-day droughts cause relatively small and transient changes to Mediterranean stream fish assemblages. However, longer and more severe droughts expected under altered future climates, may result in declines or local extinctions of the most sensitive species and their potential replacement by more resistant species. Changing drought regimes thus need to be duly considered in the development of conservation strategies for Mediterranean stream fish.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,8,,1494,1510,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01781.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000247905900008

We report the results of a monitoring program that includes 2 years of data prior to the Cerro Grande fire in New Mexico, and 3 years of postfire data. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) increased by about 2 orders of magnitude following the fire, and the proportion of silt and clay increased from 50% to 80%. For a given flow event, SSC is highest at the flood bore and decreases monotonically with time, a pattern evident in every flood sampled both before and after the fire. We propose that the accumulation of flow and wash load at the flow front is an inherent characteristic of ephemeral stream flows, due to amplified momentum losses at the flood bore. We present a new model for computing suspended sediment transport in ephemeral streams ( in the presence or absence of wildfire) by relating SSC to the time following the arrival of the flood bore, rather than to instantaneous discharge. Using this model and a rainfall history, we estimate that in the 3 years following the fire, floods transported in suspension a mass equivalent to about 3 mm of landscape lowering across the burn area, 20% of this following a single rainstorm. We test the model by computing fine sediment delivery to a small reservoir in an adjacent watershed, where we have a detailed record of postfire sedimentation based on repeat surveys.

In the present work, we study the pulse entrance of mining wastes through two temporary streams (wadis) into the Mar Menor coastal lagoon in two torrential rain events and during a dry period. The characteristics of the runoff pointed to the generation of acid mine drainages in wastes, the acidified stormwater runoff loaded with particulate and dissolved heavy metals causing toxicity in the lagoon waters. The dissolved metals, which mainly affected the sampling stations located close to the wadi discharges, were rapidly eliminated from the water column, whereas the particulate metals were transported further and affected a wider area. Finally, both particulate and dissolved metals are eliminated from the water column and are accumulated in the sediments of the lagoon. The results of the water toxicity tests using sea-urchin embryos indicated that water toxicity disappeared within a few days in the most distant stations, but lasted longer and depended on the climatic conditions of the subsequent days in stations closer to the wadi outlets.",CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,23,3,,217,231,,10.1080/02757540701339422,,,,,,0275-7540,,WOS:000248117200003

This control is particularly evident in semiarid streams, where hydrologic connectivity between stream, riparian, and upland systems increases greatly during storms in the rainy season. We measured chloride concentrations in base flow, precipitation, soil water, and stream water to quantify the hydrologic connectivity and solute flux between soil water, groundwater, and the stream channel during six summer floods in 2001 (a wet year; 25 cm winter rain) and 2002 (a dry year; 5 cm winter rain) in the San Pedro River, southeastern Arizona. This hydrologic information was used to evaluate observed patterns in nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in floods. The first floods of each year showed increased stream nitrate concentration that was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than base flow concentration. DOC consistently doubled to tripled during storm events, while DON in 2001 showed no response and showed a marked increase in 2002. A chloride mixing model indicated that soil and groundwater contributions to storm water discharge were related to antecedent conditions and to flood magnitude. Soil and groundwater contributions were the highest early in the 2001 monsoon season following the wet winter, much lower early in 2002 following a dry winter, and lowest during the largest floods of the 2002 monsoon season when flows were derived primarily from precipitation and overland flow. Stream water nitrate-N concentrations during floods were consistently 0.2-0.5 mg/L higher in 2002 than during 2001, suggesting greater over-winter accumulation of soil nitrate during the drier year. This result is consistent with higher mean nitrate-N concentrations in soil water of the riparian zone in 2002 (3.1 mg/L) than in 2001 (0.56 mg/L).

Small streams differ widely in physical, chemical, and biotic attributes, thus providing habitats for a range of unique species. Headwater species include permanent residents as well as migrants that travel to headwaters at particular seasons or life stages. Movement by migrants links headwaters with downstream and terrestrial ecosystems, as do exports such as emerging and drifting insects. We review the diversity of taxa dependent on headwaters. Exemplifying this diversity are three unmapped headwaters that support over 290 taxa. Even intermittent streams may support rich and distinctive biological communities, in part because of the predictability of dry periods. The influence of headwaters on downstream systems emerges from their attributes that meet unique habitat requirements of residents and migrants by: offering a refuge from temperature and flow extremes, competitors, predators, and introduced species; serving as a source of colonists; providing spawning sites and rearing areas; being a rich source of food; and creating migration corridors throughout the landscape.

The Supreme Court's majority opinion addressed broader issues of CWA jurisdiction by implying that the CWA intended some ""connection"" to navigability and that isolated waters need a ""significant nexus"" to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision (SWANCC), there have been many lawsuits challenging CWA jurisdiction, many of which are focused on headwater, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams throughout the U.S., summarize major findings from the scientific literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientific information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53% (2,900,000 km) of the total stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise approximately 59% (3,200,000 km) of the total stream length and approximately 50% (1,460,000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological connectivity, headwater, intermittent and ephemeral streams cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they are a part of the tributary system. As this debate continues, scientific input from multiple fields will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local levels and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made.

Ephemeral stream channels transport forest floor litter and soil materials from upland hillslopes to alluvial fans. Improved understanding of how ephemeral streams transport and process forest-floor organic materials could improve conservation of ecologically important and productive headwater alluvial fans. We analyzed organic and mineral materials from source to mouth along two ephemeral streams and analyzed suspended sediments from four collection traps in each. Results suggest that decomposition processes differ by reach and frequent, low-energy flows preferentially transport organic detritus as it decomposes. Processing of organic-rich sediments in canyon reaches is dominated by microbial immobilization (low inorganic N and available P, high C/N ratio). Arroyo reaches receive organic materials chiefly from upstream so mineralization plays in increasing role as materials are transported and decomposed downstream without fresh inputs. The frequency of flow decreases in a downstream direction as water infiltrates sandy streambeds. In lower arroyo and fan reaches, inputs of organic-rich sediments are infrequent. Relatively frequent wetting and drying stimulates mineralization of organic materials so concentrations of inorganic N and available P in detritus are relatively high.

Several taxa, especially mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, were present only at the upstream reach. Shannon diversity was similar between the two reaches on 50% of the dates. Ordination analysis clearly separated the samples of the upstream reach from the samples of the downstream reach in the first axis and corroborated the effect of the point Source on the benthic community. The two reaches followed a similar temporal pattern with respect to the distribution of taxa along the second axis of the Ordination analysis. Higher similarities between the two reaches in taxa composition, densities and biomass after the spates of April and May 2002, suggest that flooding events may act its a reset mechanism for benthic communities and play an important role in stream restoration.

Drainage area above the sampling site explained almost 58% of the variation in species richness. Larger drainage areas had a higher number of species, including those endemic to the basin.5. Patterns of habitat use were examined to identify species preferences with respect to the erosional-depositional gradient. Islamia minuta, Pisidium casertanum and Pisidium personatum find their optimum habitat in headwaters, whereas Theodoxus fluviatilis, Mercuria emiliana, Radix auricularia and all unionid species inhabit large and stable habitats downstream without marine influence.6. Populations of invasive Corbicula fluminea were found in the Guadiana River basin, both in rivers with large drainage areas and in brackish waters near the mouths of rivers.

A total of 126 taxa included in 67 genera of chironomid larvae were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that variation in the assemblage structure of chironomids was primarily explained by temperature, altitude and geology, together with hydrological factors such as discharge and dry period, which play an important role in structuring communities in Mediterranean streams. A final classification based solely on Chironomidae reference assemblages produced four biological groups, and the corresponding indicator taxa were identified. One group is almost exclusively formed by summer samples, showing that seasonal differences are one of the most important driving forces behind differences in Chironomidae assemblage composition in Mediterranean streams. Furthermore we tested the agreement between Chironomidae assemblages and three river ecotypes (WFD approach) obtained after conducting an environmental classification in the Mediterranean region of Spain. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a large overlap of chironomid assemblages among ecotypes, although communities belonging to the ecotype ""Siliceous headwaters and high altitude streams"" proved to be the most different from the other ecotypes studied. Our results suggest that a top-down classification of streams (using ecotypes) does not necessarily imply exclusive assemblages of chironomids. Thus, classification based on biological data may be more appropriate than environmental classification with subsequent testing using biological data. These findings have important implications for the application of the WFD in Mediterranean streams.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,170,2,,149,165,,10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0170-0149,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000251958100006

This study addresses this issue, by analysing its abundance and feeding patterns in the lower Guadiana drainage (Portugal), during the dry season of 2003. Despite slight spatial variations in abundance and individual size, A. facetus seemed well established in the Guadiana, Vascao and Ardila rivers. No seasonal or size-related changes in feeding intensity were found, but the diet changed across rivers, over time and throughout ontogeny. Feeding seemed highly generalist, with fish apparently reacting to both spatial and temporal changes in food supply and tending to use the most abundant and easily accessible food items. Overall prey breadth was broad relative to that of other native and non-native species. It is suggested that a generalist feeding strategy may play a significant role in the establishment of non-native fish in mediterranean-type rivers.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,16,4,,559,569,,10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00252.x,,2nd Ecology of Stream Fish Meeting,"JUN 12-16, 2006",,"Leon, SPAIN",0906-6691,,WOS:000251026000011

Most solutes are conserved during flow along the reach, but [NO(3)(-)] decreases by similar to 30% and is accompanied by net loss of channel discharge and extensive surface-subsurface exchange. The corresponding net NO(3)(-) uptake length is 37 +/- 13 km (42 +/- 12 km when normalized to the conservative solute Cl(-)), and the areal NO(3)(-) uptake rate is 0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The observed reduction in [NO(3)(-)] along the reach results from one or more internal sinks, not dilution by ground water, hill-slope water, or other water inputs. Observed reductions in [NO(3)(-)] and channel discharge along the experimental reach result in a net loss of 200-400 kg/d of NO(3)(-)-N, similar to 50% of the input load. High-resolution (temporal and spatial) sampling indicates that most of the NO(3)(-) loss occurs along the lower part of the reach, where there is the greatest seepage loss and surface-subsurface exchange of water. Stable isotopes of NO(3)(-), total dissolved P concentrations, and streambed chemical profiles suggest that denitrification is the most significant NO(3)(-)sink along the reach. Denitrification efficiency, as expressed through downstream enrichment in (15)N-NO(3)(-), varies considerably during the water year. When discharge is greater (typically earlier in the water year), denitrification is least efficient and downstream enrichment in (15)N-NO(3)(-) is greatest. When discharge is lower, denitrification in the streambed appears to occur with greater efficiency, resulting in lower downstream enrichment in (15)N-NO(3)(-)",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,26,2,,191,206,,10.1899/0887-3593(2007)26[191:NDWTPR]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000246417700003

To understand the ecological and behavioural adaptive mechanisms of the otter to seasonal river streams, a study was carried out in the Bergantes River, Spain. We compared pond use by radiotracked otters during a ""normal"" and a ""dry"" period. The otters were detected significantly more often at ponds and their surroundings during the dry period. Pond use was mainly explained by the total biomass available (fish, crayfish, amphibians), and this was mostly correlated with the maximum depth of the pond. Some evidence of progressive pond depletion was obtained. Sprainting behaviour was mainly linked to predation activities (number of prey remains) and to total biomass available.

According to the guidelines of the European Water Framework Directive, assessment of the ecological quality of streams and rivers should be based on ecotype-specific reference conditions. Here, we assess two approaches for establishing a typology for Mediterranean streams: a top-down approach using environmental variables and bottom-up approach using macroinvertebrate assemblages.2. Classification of 162 sites using environmental variables resulted in five ecotypes: (i) temporary streams; (ii) evaporite calcareous streams at medium altitude; (iii) siliceous headwater streams at high altitude; (iv) calcareous headwater streams at medium to high altitude and (v) large watercourses.3. Macroinvertebrate communities of minimally disturbed sites (n = 105), grouped using UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) on Bray-Curtis similarities, were used to validate four of the five ecotypes obtained using environmental variables; ecotype 5, large watercourses, was not included as this group had no reference sites.4. Analysis of similarities (anosim) showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage composition differed among three of the four ecotypes, resulting in differences between the bottom-up and top-down classification approaches. Siliceous streams were clearly different from the other three ecotypes, evaporite and calcareous ecotypes did not show large differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages and temporary streams formed a very heterogeneous group because of large variability in salinity and hydrology.5. This study showed that stream classification schemes based on environmental variables need to be validated using biological variables.

We have examined the influence of the deposit of a 15 cm gravel layer over the stream bottom on the chemical characteristics of the interstitial water, the sediment grain size and the composition of the benthic assemblages. We have compared a restored reach to an upstream control over three years and at three seasons each year. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate contents were measured in both surface and interstitial (-15 cm deep) waters, together with the depth of anoxia estimated using wooden stakes and fine sediment content at the surface. During the same period and seasons, benthic invertebrates were sampled at five points in each reach. The restoration induced an increase in vertical exchanges of water between surface and interstitial habitats, with an increase in the depth of hypoxia. Changes were observed in the composition of invertebrate communities, but not in the density or in the taxonomic richness of assemblages. These changes in assemblages were fragile: a local disturbance (such as a drying period) diminished the beneficial effect of the restoration with the disappearance of several organisms. The viability of such restoration works may be associated with catchment management designed to reduce fine sediment inputs to the river.

To maintain the large inter- annual variability of streamflow as prevails in Southern Arizona, the model framework is constructed to produce three types of seasonal winter and summer categories of streamflow ( i. e., wet, medium, or dry). Longterm ( i. e., 100 years) realizations ( ensembles) are generated by the above described model framework that reflects two different regimes of inter annual variability. The first regime is that of the historic streamflow gauge record. The second regime is that of the tree ring reconstructed precipitation, which was derived for the study location.

Variation in fish assemblages was partitioned into eight unique components: pure environmental, pure spatial, pure temporal, spatially structured environmental variation, temporally structured environmental variation, spatially structured temporal variation, the combined spatial/temporal component of environmental variation and unexplained variation. The total variation explained by these components was 65%. The combined spatial/temporal/environmental component explained the largest component (30%) of the total variation in fish assemblages, whereas pure environmental (6%), temporal (9%) and spatial (2%) effects were relatively unimportant.

Diatom analysis was restricted to epilithic taxa. and the sites included gradients ranging from near-natural streams to sites with poor ecological quality. The main gradient shows a clear separation of sites in relation to the degree of human influence: polluted streams (mainly located in the lowlands) differ from streams in mountainous areas and in the Pyrenees. A second gradient is related to physiographical features. Headwater streams can be distinguished by their catchment geology. The type-specific diatom taxa for the stream types studied were determined by using indicator species analysis (IndVal). The type-specific taxa from near-natural streams are coincident with the indicator taxa for high ecological status. Human impact reduced the typological heterogeneity of the diatom community composition. Overall, the diatom communities in NE Spain exhibit a regional distribution pattern that closely corresponds with that observed in river systems elsewhere.

If aquatic invertebrates are to take advantage of such habitats, they must be capable of rapid colonization and growth. Aerial immigration is one means of colonization and may include active dispersal by reproductive and nonreproductive adult insects and passive dispersal of other invertebrates. The aquatic invertebrate assemblage that could develop from aerial colonization during the time of a flood was investigated with floating colonization trays containing natural detritus and water on the water surface of a southeastern USA floodplain during 5 flooded periods in a year. Density and biomass of aquatic invertebrates that resulted from aerial colonization were measured after 17 d. Minimum growth rates and potential secondary production of several chironomid taxa were measured based on increases in larval size during this time period. Egg-mass collection trays, similar to colonization trays, were placed in the floodplain to estimate an egg-laying flux of chironomids (egg masses m(-2) d(-1)) during the same 5 periods. Aquatic insects, including dipterans, ephemeropterans, and odonates, oviposited in trays during April, June, August, and November, but not January. Adult coleopterans and hemipterans colonized by nonreproductive immigration during June, August, and April. Noninsect invertebrates, such as micro-crustaceans, nematodes, and water mites, colonized the trays during all months, apparently by hitchhiking or wind dispersal. The highest density of insects occurred in August (78,600 ind./m(2)) and the lowest in November (159 ind./m(2)). Chironomids had the highest relative abundance of insects in June and August (> 75%), but did not colonize in November or January. Chironomids had minimum daily growth rates between 0.271 and 0.515/d, and chironomid secondary production ranged between 0 (November and January) and 230.9 mg m(-2) d(-1) (August). Egg-laying fluxes were similar in June (12 egg masses m(-2) d(-1)) and August (6 egg masses m(-2) d(-1)) but no chironomid egg masses were collected in November, January, or April. Aquatic invertebrates may arise from several sources (including recovery from dormancy or drift) in inundated floodplains, but aerial colonization and rapid growth rates alone can reestablish a diverse assemblage quickly, at least during warmer parts of the year. However, floodplains of regulated rivers managed for biological productivity should be inundated for a time period that enables colonization and completion of life cycles, a minimum of 2 wk for the fastest growing taxa.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,26,3,,460,471,,10.1899/06-057.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000248351600009

A karstic spring flow model was developed for the estimation of daily spring flows into the watershed from its extended karst area. The karstic model assumes the existence of an upper (faster) and a lower (slower) reservoir that represent the two different karstic formations of the region. The karstic spring flow model was coupled with a watershed model, the Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) in order to simulate the hydrology, sediment transport and nutrient loads of Krathis river basin. Forty two percent of Krathis river flow was estimated to be from the contribution of the karstic springs. The combined models simulated the time response of the watershed based on geochemical and hydrologic mass balances. The seasonal variability of flow and the concentrations of suspended solids and nutrients was captured by the simulations. The karstic model was shown to be a useful toot for analyzing karstic systems by estimating the contributing area of the karst and its response to precipitation events. This framework can be used to simulate watersheds where karstic geologic formations predominate. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Krathis River exhibited high annual flow variability and its transmission losses become significant, especially during the dry months. These transmission losses are enhanced in chemistry due to release of nutrients from river sediments. These fluxes are significant because they correspond to 11% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux of the river. Release of nitrogen species was influenced by temperature, while release of phosphate was not because phosphate levels were below the equilibrium concentration. There is a significant amount of sediments with fine composition that create ""hot spot"" areas in the river reach. These sediments are mobilized during the first flush events in the fall carrying with them a significant load of nutrient and suspended matter to the coastal zone.

In this study, the concentrations and fate of total DOC (TDOC) and a subset of four molecular weight fractions (< 1 kDa, 1-10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, > 100 kDa) were investigated in stream water and riparian groundwater during autumn of 2003 and 2004. The two study periods were characterized by contrasting antecedent hydrological conditions: the streamflow was interrupted in summer 2003 but was permanent in summer 2004. Comparison of the two study periods indicates that an abrupt dry-wet hydrological transition amplifies the water exchange across the stream-riparian interface and favors retention of up to 57% of the TDOC that flows across the interface. Furthermore, the efficiency of DOC retention across the stream-riparian interface also varies greatly depending on DOC molecular size. More than 70% of DOC fractions higher than 10 kDa were retained, whereas the smaller fraction (less than 1 kDa) was nearly conserved. Consequently, our study helps to clarify the effects of extreme hydrological events on DOC transport in running waters in Mediterranean regions.",ECOSYSTEMS,10,2,,239,251,,10.1007/s10021-007-9016-0,,,,,,1432-9840,,WOS:000248135200005
Fish,2007,"Vinyoles, D.; De Sostoa, A.",Life-history traits of the endangered river blenny Salaria fluviatilis (Asso) and their implications for conservation,"The life-history characteristics of the river blenny Salaria fluviatilis in a Mediterranean stream in north-east Spain have been studied. The maximum age observed was 4+ years in both sexes, although only age groups 0+ and 1+ years were well represented. For both sexes, growth was rapid between April and June (before the summer drought) and in October. The instantaneous rate of monthly growth (April to October) was positively correlated with water depth. All fish attained sexual maturity during their first year of life. Females spawned multiple times. Spawning occurred mainly from June to August, although older females (2+ years old) began in May. The relationship between fecundity and total length recorded for older females in the spring was not significantly different from that obtained for 1 year-old females in the summer. The mean diameter of ripe oocytes, however, was greater in older females. Larger eggs that were laid during a period of good food supply (spring) might have a higher probability of survival. The results suggest that female fecundity is affected by environmental conditions. The species is characterized by fast growth, early maturity, multiple spawning and limited longevity. This may be a good life-history strategy for small fish species in unstable environments, where adult mortality is high, variable or unpredictable. Some life-history traits of the river blenny suggest that this species might be vulnerable to more severe drought conditions than those associated with the Mediterranean climate.",JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,70,4,,1088,1108,,10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01371.x,,,,,,0022-1112,,WOS:000245609600008
Biogeochemistry,2007,"Von Schiller, Daniel; Marti, Eugenia; Riera, Joan Lluis; Sabater, Francesc",Effects of nutrients and light on periphyton biomass and nitrogen uptake in Mediterranean streams with contrasting land uses,"1. Nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) were used to determine the relative importance of nutrients and light as potential limiting factors of periphyton biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake in Mediterranean streams subjected to different human impacts. The nutrients examined were phosphorus (P) and N, and we also further differentiated between the response of periphyton communities to N species (i.e. NO3-N and NH4-N). To examine the effect of light and nutrients on periphyton biomass, chlorophyll a accrual rates on NDS located at open and closed canopy sites were compared. The effect of nutrient availability on periphyton uptake was measured by N-15 changes on the NDS after NO3-N-15 short-term nutrient additions.2. Results show that light was the main factor affecting algal biomass in the study streams. Algal biomass was in general higher at open than at closed canopy sites. Nutrient availability, as simulated with the NDS experiments, did not enhance algal biomass accrual in either of the 2 light conditions.3. In the control treatments (i.e. ambient concentrations), periphyton NO3-N uptake rates increased and C : N molar ratios decreased consistently with increases in N availability across streams. NO3-N uptake rates were altered when ambient N concentrations were increased artificially in the N amended NDS. Periphyton assemblages growing on N enriched substrata seemed to preferentially take up N diffusing from the substratum rather than N from the water column. This response differed among streams, and depended on ambient N availability.4. Periphyton biomass was not significantly different between substrata exposed to the two forms of available N sources. Nonetheless, we found differences in the effects of both N sources on the uptake of N from the water column. NH4-N seemed to be the preferred source of N for periphyton growing on NDS.5. Results suggest that the effect of riparian zones on light availability, although seldom considered by water managers, may be more important than nutrients in controlling eutrophication effects derived from human activities. Finally, our results confirm that not only increases in concentration, but also stoichiometric imbalances should be considered when examining N retention in human altered streams.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,5,,891,906,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01742.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000245987200009
Assessment,2007,"Xia, Jun; Zhang, Lu; Liu, Changming; Yu, Jingjie",Towards better water security in North China,"Water shortages and related environmental degradation in North China are major issues facing the country. As runoff from the mountainous parts of the region steadily decrease and water resources become overcommitted, serious water and environmental problems have resulted. These include drying-up of rivers, decline in groundwater levels, degradation of lakes and wetlands, and water pollution. Thus, 4000,km of the lower reaches of the Hai River - some 40% of its length - has experienced zero flows and, as result, parts of this river have become an ephemeral stream. The area of wetland within the Basin has decreased from 10,000 km(2) at the beginning of 1950s to 1,000 km(2) at present. Over-extraction of groundwater occurs beneath 70% of the North China Plain, with the total groundwater over-extraction estimated at 90 billion m(3). Thus, problems of water shortage and related environmental issues in North China have become the most significant limiting factors affecting sustainable development in this important region of China.

Biogeochemistry,2007,"Ylla, Irene; Romani, Anna M.; Sabater, Sergi",Differential effects of nutrients and light on the primary production of stream algae and mosses,"Benthic algae and mosses are the main primary producers in headwater streams. In these ecosystems, primary production is mainly determined by the availability of light and nutrients. The present study analyses the different effects of nutrient enrichment (inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen) and light availability on the primary production of both algal and moss communities from a headwater forested stream using laboratory experiments. These laboratory experiments consider four treatments (low light-unenriched, high light-unenriched, low light-enriched and high light-enriched). Photosynthesis-irradiance curves of both communities were also performed. Respiration and net primary production (NPP) of algae and mosses were measured using incubation chambers and oxygen balance measurements. The moss community was dominated by Fontinalis antipyretica and diatom epiphytes, while the algal community consisted of Cladophora glomerata and attached diatoms. Under all treatments, NPP was significantly higher for algae (3-18 mg O(2) mg chl(-1)h(-1)) than for mosses (0.4 and 1.8 mg O(2), mg chl(-1) h(-1)). Light (as a single factor) significantly affected GPP (gross primary production) and NPP of algae and mosses. Non-inhibitory effects of GPP were observed at saturating light conditions, showing the high plasticity of the stream algal and moss communities. Nutrients produced a significant enhancement of NPP only under high light availability. The greater response of algae to nutrient enrichment was also shown by the highest phosphate uptake rate of this community. Extrapolation of laboratory primary production measurements to the field scale showed the occurrence of significant autotrophic production pulses during periods of light availability (e.g. before leaf emergence and after leaf fall in Mediterranean forested streams), in contrast to the major heterotrophic behaviour, especially in autumn, of these ecosystems. These production pulses in heterotrophic streams could provide high-quality resources to downstream reach, which might be essential for consumers.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,170,1,,1,10,,10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0170-001,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000251469200001
Assessment,2007,"Zheng, Hongxing; Zhang, Lu; Liu, Changming; Shao, Quanxi; Fukushima, Yoshihiro",Changes in stream flow regime in headwater catchments of the Yellow River basin since the 1950s,"The headwater catchments of the Yellow River basin generate over 35% of the basin's total stream flow and play a vital role in meeting downstream water resources requirements. In recent years the Yellow River has experienced significant changes in its hydrological regime, including an increased number of zero-flow days. These changes have serious implications for water security and basin management. We investigated changes in stream flow regime of four headwater catchments since the 1950s. The rank-based non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends in annual stream flow. The results showed no significant trend for the period 1956 to 2000. However, change-point analysis showed that a significant change in annual stream flow occurred around 1990, and hence the stream-flow data can be divided into two periods: 1956-1990 and 1991-2000. There was a considerable difference in average annual stream flow between the two periods, with a maximum reduction of 51%. Wet-season rainfall appears to be the main factor responsible for the decreasing trend in annual stream flow. Reductions in annual stream flow were associated with decreased interannual variability in stream flow. Seasonal stream flow distribution changed from bimodal to unimodal between the two periods, with winter stream flow showing a greater reduction than other seasons. Daily stream flow regime represented by flow duration curves showed that all percentile flows were decreased in the second period. The high flow index (Q(5)/Q(50)) reduced by up to 28%, whereas the reduction in the low flow index (Q(95)/Q(50)) is more dramatic, with up to 100% reduction.

The natural seasonal drying and flooding of southern California streams have been altered over the past century by activities related to agriculture, flood control, and reservoir construction. The genetic structure and diversity of aquatic invertebrates inhabiting these environments is largely unexplored, and may be important for conservation.2. We sampled two species of aquatic invertebrates with different dispersal abilities to assess genetic structure and diversity, and make inferences about the evolutionary processes that underlie these genetic patterns. The mayfly Fallceon quilleri, which has a winged terrestrial stage, was sampled from perennial and intermittent streams from three catchments across San Diego County. The amphipod Hyalella azteca was sampled from streams (perennial and intermittent) and reservoirs in a single catchment (San Dieguito). Because it is obligately aquatic throughout its life-cycle, H. azteca was assumed to disperse less than F. quilleri.3. Intrapopulation and overall genetic diversity was higher in F. quilleri than in H. azteca. In F. quilleri there was very little genetic divergence among populations, and most of the genetic differentiation that was observed could be attributed to a single population. In H. azteca, populations were markedly differentiated between the upper and lower segments of the San Dieguito basin, which are separated by a c. 10 km section of stream that rarely has surface flow. Within both segments, genetic divergence between sites connected by reservoirs and perennial streams was not significantly different.4. Our results suggest that F. quilleri disperses widely and thus avoids genetic bottlenecks and marked levels of population differentiation that may be expected from frequent extinctions and recolonizations. In contrast, restricted dispersal in H. azteca is associated with relatively low genetic diversity and high genetic divergence across a portion of the catchment in which surface flow is rare.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,52,10,,1982,1996,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01822.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000249276200010

However, the effect of drying has not yet adequately been evaluated when analyzing riverine microbiological processes. The bacterial community structure (abundance, biomass, composition) and functioning (carbon production, live cell percentage) were assessed during experimental desiccation in microcosms with sediments from different Mediterranean temporary rivers (Tagliamento, Krathis, Mulargia, Pardiela). Our results showed that the overall responses to drying of the bacterial community were independent from sediment origin and strictly related to water content. During desiccation, a prompt decline (up to 100%) of the initial bacterial carbon production was followed by a slower decrease in abundance and biomass, with an overall reduction of 74% and 78%, respectively. By the end of the experiment, live cells were still abundant but depressed in their main metabolic functions, thus resulting in a drastic increase in the community turnover time. Only 14% of the initial live cell biomass was available in dry sediments to immediately start the reactivation of the aquatic microbial food web after the arrival of new water. Community composition analysis showed a relative increase in alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria, when passing from wet to dry conditions.

Relationships were examined between microbial decomposition activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenoloxidase, peroxidase, peptidase and phosphatase) at different stream substrata (leaves, branches, sand and gravel) and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of attached microbial communities and stream water matter fractions (particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations). Microbial communities associated to leaves and branches showed higher C:N and lower N:P molar ratios (averaging 21.7 +/- 1.4 and 5.4 +/- 2.1, respectively) and higher polysaccharide degrading activity (sum of beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities). Instead, biofilms on sand and gravel. where algae accumulate and fine particulate material were more available, showed lower C:N and higher N:P molar ratios (averaging 10.3 +/- 0.6 and 19.9 +/- 3.7, respectively) and greater ligninolytic (sum of phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities) and peptidase activities. These results suggest that enzyme activities of microbial attached communities are linked to their nutrient molar ratios and, at the same time, these might be modulated by the different nature of available organic matter (OM) in each substratum and the microbial groups accumulated (algae, bacteria, fungi, micro- and meiofauna). However. similarities (C:N) and divergences (N:P) between stream water and nutrient molar ratios in microbial communities may also affect nutrient demands and in consequence, the expression of extracellular enzymes.

Changes to ground cover affect both the hydrological and geochemical characteristics in a watershed. Ecosystem degradation also occurs in undisturbed watersheds at the ""urban fringe"" due to regional atmospheric deposition. These urban fringe catchments can also serve as an upstream source of various chemical constituents into downstream (urban) river systems. The current study focuses on the impacts of regional urbanization in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed located on the eastern edge of the Los Angeles basin, where estimates of dry deposition are considered some of the highest in North America. Collected hydrologic, geochemical and atmospheric data were assessed at seasonal time scales to evaluate current hydrochemical. dynamics. Stream water chemical composition in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed exhibits significant seasonal variability, particularly for [NO(3)(-)]. Almost all study solutes show dilution behavior. However, hydrologically enhanced behavior was observed for [NO(3)(-)] with increased concentrations during the wet season. Seasonal stream concentration-discharge relationships were developed using a hyperbolic dilution model The developed model was then used to predict concentrations for observational gaps in stream water chemical composition, allowing for seasonal and annual mass loadings to be estimated for the downstream urban stream. The hydrological. signal in the resultant chemical loads is extremely strong, especially during the wet season.

J.; Vila-Gispert, A.; Garcia-Berthou, E.",Assessing fish metrics and biotic indices in a Mediterranean stream: effects of uncertain native status of fish,"Implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires tools for measuring and monitoring the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Several indices are in use in the Iberian Peninsula, although there has been little comparison among them. We sampled the fish assemblage and limnological features of the Tordera stream (NE Spain) quarterly from September 2001 to May 2003 to evaluate the usefulness of several fish metrics and to compare habitat quality and biotic indices currently in use. Data for eight biotic and abiotic indices for this and three other Catalan river basins were also compiled in order to analyse the relationships among indices. In the Tordera stream, fish abundance and richness increased with stream order except in the last sampling site that had the lowest fish abundance owing to the effects of drought and water abstraction. Although most indices were positively correlated, some displayed low or null correlations particularly for the Tordera basin which is more affected by water abstraction and less by pollution; a commonly used physico-chemical index (ISQA) was the least correlated. In a regional fish index (IBICAT) under development, the brown trout (Salmo trutta) has been previously considered as introduced in the Tordera basin. Here, we report an old published record that demonstrates that trout was present before 1845 and we argue that its status should be considered as uncertain given the current information available. Whether brown trout is treated as native or introduced to this river basin has profound effects on the results of fish metrics because of its dominance in the upper reaches. We briefly discuss the role of introduced species, particularly in headwater streams, in the development of fish indices.

The two catchments were mainly underlain by granitic rocks and different types of sericitic schists. Only the lowland catchment had an alluvial zone and a well-developed riparian forest. The rainfall-runoff relationship and the correlation between daily flow concentrations showed that hydrological behaviour was similar at both sites during most of the year. However, reverse fluxes were detected during the wetting and drying up periods only in the stream with an alluvial zone. The intermittence in stream flow also had effects on absolute solute concentrations, temporal solute dynamics and streamwater stoichiometry. Streamwater chemistry was not affected by drainage area, except for cations produced mainly by bedrock dissolution (i.e. calcium and magnesium) that increased with increasing catchment size. Differences in the relationship among cations and anions were detected between the two streams, which could be attributed to biogeochemical processes occurring in the alluvial zone. The multivariate model used in this study showed that stoichiometry was more useful than absolute concentrations when analyzing the influence of different lithologies on streamwater chemistry. Such differences were amplified in autumn, likely due to a low hydrological connectivity between the two nested catchments.

Similar constraints in distant, but climatically comparable, regions may be expected to yield biotic assemblages with similar attributes. Environmental factors that constrain communities at smaller scales, however, may be different between climatically similar regions. Thus, patterns observed at large scales may differ from those detected at small scales, and international comparisons should be focussed at multiple scales.2. Mediterranean-climate regions (MCRs) are characterized by remarkable seasonal variability in precipitation and temperature. Accordingly, rivers in these regions have seasonal and predictable floods and droughts, and temporary reaches are frequent. Present in six geographical regions of the world, MCRs have similar environmental constraints and are ideal for testing intercontinental similarities between macroinvertebrate communities.3. We examined aquatic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and composition in MCRs at three scales: regional, reach and macrohabitat. At the regional scale, the Mediterranean Basin had the highest taxon richness at family level, and southwestern Australia the lowest. Taxonomic composition showed c. 85% similarity between the northern hemisphere MCRs of California and the Mediterranean Basin, which were followed in similarity by South Africa. The two Australian MCRs (South west and South) showed a similarity to each other of about 70% whereas the Chilean fauna was the most distinct.4. At the reach scale, taxon richness was not significantly different between permanent and temporary reaches in any MCR, whereas taxonomic composition was significantly different among northern hemisphere MCRs. At the macrohabitat scale, taxon richness was not significantly different between lotic and lentic macrohabitats within any of the MCRs, but differences in macroinvertebrate communities were found between macrohabitats when considering regions.5. Our results show that the strength of similarity between distant but climatically similar regions is scale-dependent, being highest at the macrohabitat scale. Although the similarities in richness and composition at the macrohabitat scale are presumed to be universal, the seasonal predictability of drought in MCRs is expected to result in characteristic macroinvertebrate responses at the reach scale. We suggest, however, that regional evolutionary history and environmental characteristics may override this general pattern of a similar response of MCRs at different scales. The Mediterranean Basin and California, having similar historical and environmental condition, thus appeared as the most similar MCRs at all scales.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,53,4,,772,788,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01940.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000253886900010

The present study examined the contribution of floodplain sources to the productivity of a disconnected dryland river; that is a waterhole, after a major overland flood event. Rate measures of productivity were combined with stable isotope and biomass data on the food web in the waterhole and floodplain. The present study estimated that 50% of the fish carbon in the waterhole after flooding was derived from floodplain food sources. In the few months after retraction of the river to isolated waterholes, the large biomass of fish concentrated from the flooding decreased by 80%, most likely as a result of starvation. Based on the development of a carbon budget for the waterhole, mass mortality is hypothesised to be the cause of the high rates of heterotrophic production in the waterhole. The present study suggests that floodplain inputs are important for fuelling short-term production in waterholes, but via an unconventional pathway; that is, fish mortality. The episodic nature of flooding in dryland rivers means that changes in flow regimes, such as water regulation or abstraction, will reduce flooding and hence floodplain subsidies to the river.

However, concentration-discharge ( C-Q) responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events. In consequence, it is difficult to quantify the diversity of C-Q responses in a hydrological system and impossible to assess whether the succession of forms of C-Q responses follows a predictable sequence or not. Bearing in mind these shortfalls, the variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3) pulses during storms is analyzed in a detailed 4-year series from an intermittent Mediterranean stream. In this study, each DOC and NO3-Q response is synthesized by two descriptors that summarize its trend (Delta C; dilution/flushing/no change) and shape (Delta R; linear/nonlinear response). We observe that C-Q responses are widely distributed along the two-dimensional Delta R versus Delta C continuum. Furthermore, the temporal succession of forms of DOC and NO3-Q responses follow a random pattern, and only the dynamics of the Delta R-(NO3) descriptor show periodicity. The long-term data set reveals that it is impossible to predict with reasonable precision the full properties of DOC and NO3-Q responses. Thus, a ""typical'' C-Q response does not really exist at our study site, and this apparent diversity of responses has to be handled with a probabilistic approach that allows synthesis of the complexity of the hydro-biogeochemical functioning of a specific catchment.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,113,G3,,,,G03016,10.1029/2008JG000721,,,,,,0148-0227,,WOS:000258339700001

From 1991 to 1995, pupal exuviae were collected at irregular intervals in the permanent stream, but the temporary stream was dry because of a long-lasting drought in the region. From March 1996 to March 2000, pupal exuviae were collected fortnightly in both streams. In contrast to other comparative studies that found more species in permanent than in temporary streams, our 2 streams harbored similar temporal I and a diversity during the 1996 to 2000 study period. This result might be explained by the relatively long time the temporary stream was flowing. In addition, the temporary stream showed higher temporal P diversity than the permanent stream, a result that might be attributable to the greater variability in temperature and substrates in the temporary stream. Spates scarcely affected alpha diversity and favored colonization by new species in both streams, a result that supports the patch-dynamic concept of streams. A period of >1 y without spates also resulted in colonization by new species in the permanent stream, but led to a pool phase in the temporary stream that reduced cc diversity considerably. Overall, both streams had similar chironomid species richness and species rarity and high faunal complementarity.

D.; Brendonck, Luc",The influence of habitat structure and flow permanence on macroinvertebrate assemblages in temporary rivers in northwestern Zimbabwe,"Temporary rivers within the Nyaodza-Gachegache subcatchment in northwestern Zimbabwe were investigated to examine the role of flow permanence and habitat structure on macroinvertebrate community composition. Macroinvertebrate communities of intermittent and ephemeral rivers displayed significant differences in the number of taxa, macroinvertebrate abundance, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and in size class structure. Intermittent sites were characterised by higher numbers of taxa, diversity and Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness compared to ephemeral sites. The fauna of ephemeral sites was dominated by a single taxon (Afrobaetodes) (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae) whilst larger sized taxa (e.g. Elassoneuria (Ephemeroptera, Oligoneuriidae), Dicentroptilum (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae), Aethaloptera (Trichoptera, Hydropsychidae), Pseudagrion (Odonata, Coenagrionidae) and Tholymis (Odonata, Libellulidae) were exclusively restricted to intermittent sites. Clear differences were observed between sand, gravel, cobble and vegetation habitats. Vegetation and cobbles supported distinct communities, with some taxa exclusively restricted either to vegetation (e.g. Pseudagrion, Leptocerina (Trichoptera, Leptoceridae), Cloeon (Ephemeroptera, Baetidae), Afronurus (Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae) and Povilla (Ephemeroptera, Polymitarcidae) or cobble (e.g. Aethaloptera and Dicentroptilum) habitats. In terms of ensuring optimum diversity within the subcatchment, we consider conservation of critical habitats (cobbles and vegetation) and maintenance of natural flows as the appropriate management actions.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,607,,,199,209,,10.1007/s10750-008-9391-3,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000256080700019
Assessment,2008,"Chaves, Joaquin; Neill, Christopher; Germer, Sonja; Neto, Sergio Gouveia; Krusche, Alex; Elsenbeer, Helmut",Land management impacts on runoff sources in small Amazon watersheds,"Forest clearing and conversion to cattle pasture in the lowland Amazon region has been linked to soil compaction and increased soil water storage, which combine to diminish soil infiltration, enhance quick lateral flows and increase the stream flow response to precipitation. Quantifying the importance of quick surficial flow in response to this land use change requires identification of water sources within catchments that contribute to stream flow. Using an end member mixing analysis approach, potential contributing sources of stream flow were evaluated during an entire rainy season in a forest and a pasture watershed drained by ephemeral-to-intermittent streams in the south-western Amazon. Water yield was 17% of precipitation in the pasture and 0.8% of precipitation in the forest. During the early rainy season, throughfall, groundwater, and soil water contributed 79%, 18%, and 3%, respectively, to total forest stream flow. Over the entire rainy season, throughfall, groundwater, and shallow soil water provided 57%, 24%, and 19%, respectively, of stream flow. In the pasture watershed, overland flow dominated stream flow both in the early (67%) and late (57%) rainy season, with a mean contribution of 60% overland flow, 35% groundwater, and 5% soil water. The uncertainty associated with those estimates was studied using a Monte Carlo approach. In addition to large changes in total surface flow, marked differences were found in the proportions of total stream flow in the second half of the rainy season between the forest and pasture watershed. These results suggest that (1) there is great potential for alteration of the hydrological budgets of larger watersheds as the proportion of deforested land in the Amazon increases, and (2) as more rainfall is diverted into fast flowpaths to streams in established pastures, the potential to deliver water with higher solute concentrations generated by erosion or by bypassing sites of solute removal increases.

Macroinvertebrate assemblages of five non-glacial intermittent high altitude headwater streams (above 1400 m - Serra da Estrela, Portugal), with dry periods of different lengths (0-3 months), were investigated in nearly undisturbed conditions to (i) examine spatial differences and identify environmental variables responsible for the observed invertebrate patterns, (ii) assess the association of dry period length with invertebrate community structure and (iii) determine the influence of using different taxonomic identification levels (order, family and genus) to assess invertebrate community patterns.2. More than 100 macroinvertebrate genera were identified. Insects clearly dominated these communities with more than 95% of total captures and around 95% of the total richness. Diptera were the most rich and abundant group with chironomid occurrences comprising over 70% of macroinvertebrate captures.3. The highest taxon richness, diversity, EPT (Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata + Coleoptera + Heteroptera) genus richness, the greatest number of exclusive and characteristic taxa identified by the Indicator Value (IndVal), and a distinct community structure shown by Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA), were found in the only stream that was never totally dry, with pools lasting over summer. Environmental gradients that spatially structured the macroinvertebrate communities were always related to flow variations.4. Over time, the highest abundances found in these systems were also related to flow variations and maximum genus richness occurred in the connected pools or in isolated pools. Streams with longer dry periods presented a distinct recolonization phase, with higher abundance of the stonefly larvae Nemoura sp. and the presence of the chironomid larvae Krenosmittia sp., possibly arriving from the hyporheos.5. Taxonomic level of invertebrate identification was vital for recognizing the characteristic taxa (IndVal) of streams yet was not critical for identifying streams with the highest macroinvertebrate richness/diversity or structuring environmental gradients.6. Overall, this study emphasizes the variability of high altitude intermittent streams macroinvertebrate communities, despite spatial proximity. This variability was probably related to flow intermittency and hydrologic permanence, different vegetation covers and riverbed substrata. Consequently, the establishment of reference conditions should involve long-term data collections and more detailed physical characterization. Also, these findings have significant implications for accurately predicting the ecological consequences of future climate change in high altitude scenarios.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,53,1,,55,76,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01867.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000251629900005

G.",Nutrient load modelling during floods in intermittent rivers: An operational approach,"In the Mediterranean area, lagoons and coastal waters are often under the influence of intermittent rivers that contribute the majority of pollutant loads during flood events. Reliable tools for evaluating pollutant loads from land sources are needed for managing the water quality of the receiving waters, but available water quality models are not suitable for simulating these flash flood events. An operational tool, D-PoL (Diffuse-Pollution Load), to estimate the pollutant loads transferred during rainfall events by small Mediterranean rivers is described. The tool is based on a rainfall-load semi-distributed approach and was developed with the aim of simulating temporal variations in fluxes of dissolved pollutants. The model simulates pollutographs at the outlet of the catchment during rainfall events: the rainfall triggers the processes.The model can be described as a rainfall-load model. Three parameters describe the processes involved: the initial stock of pollutants on the hillslopes, the production parameter (which is related to the lag time of the catchment) and the routing parameter (which is related to the lag time of a basic river reach). First, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that each of the parameters controlled one key-feature of the pollutograph. The initial stock of pollutants influenced the amplitude of the pollutograph, the production parameter controlled the recession period, and the routing parameter influenced the rising phase. Second, the model was calibrated for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus on a 20-flood data set. The sets of optimal parameters were fitted to empirical relationships for both elements. On the 20-flood calibration data set, the simulated total loads with adjusted parameters compared well with the observed parameters, except for very small events. Finally, the D-PoL model was checked against a new set of data, a 10-flood validation data set. This final validation of the model showed that the dynamics of the pollutograph were not perfectly reproduced, but that simulated total loads agreed with the observed loads. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC). nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) concentrations decreased as water from an adjacent river mainstem moved through the flowpaths. DOC, DON, and DOP processing rates decreased with increasing mainstem flow and increased with parafluvial zone length. These patterns suggest that the surface water zones of perched river systems are organic nutrient sources to subsurface flowpaths and that parafluvial zones of these systems are strong sinks for organic matter. No longitudinal changes were detected in NO3- concentrations, and relationships between NO3- processing and hydrological variables were not significant. NO3- concentrations were uniformly high, and microbial activity and DOC and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were low, suggesting that biological NO3- removal was carbon- or phosphorus-limited. Invertebrate assemblages also varied between subsurface zones: density and taxon richness in the hyporheic and parafluvial zones were higher than in the riparian zone, and evenness was higher in the riparian zone than in the hyporheic or parafluvial zones. Distinct invertebrate assemblages in riparian zones may reflect greater hydrologic stability compared with hyporheic and parafluvial zones.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,65,8,,1532,1544,,10.1139/F08-075,,,,,,0706-652X,,WOS:000259193900003

S.",Trends in surface-water quality of an intermittent cold-desert stream,"Understanding the complex relationships among land use, geology, and climate in semiarid watersheds is essential to restoring degraded riparian areas and improving water quality. Muddy Creek in south-central Wyoming has been listed as impaired since 1996 by the US Environmental Protection Agency due to unstable stream channels and degraded riparian habitat. Water quality data collected from 1985 to 2006 were used to determine trends in surface-water. quality. Flow analyses identified reductions in percents of flow duration intervals between the impaired stream's upper and lower boundary monitoring sites and in hydrograph peaks between pre- and post-best management practice (BMP) implementation. Following BMP implementation, reductions in specific conductivity, total dissolved solids, and turbidity among years were observed in the impaired stream section. Linking water quality improvements to specific BMPs is difficult; however results strongly suggest that positive trends are correlated to BMPs that stabilized stream channels and improved the condition of riparian areas. Naturally erosive conditions in the basin along with anthropogenic impacts elevate the importance of BMP implementation and a long-term monitoring program. Both are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of improvement efforts and to help resource managers develop practical watershed improvement management strategies so that optimum conditions in Muddy Creek basin can be achieved.",JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,63,4,,212,223,,,,,,,,0022-4561,,WOS:000257757700020

Integrated models, such as any complex modelling approach, often have prohibitive data availability requirements that reduce their applicability. Moreover, widely different approaches can be applied, ranging from simple conceptual models to complex physically based ones. In the present paper, two approaches have been compared using data from an experimental catchment in Bologna ( Italy), which consists of a part of the Bologna sewer network and a reach of the Savena River. The paper shows how river modelling has the most relevant role in conditioning the overall response of the integrated approach. This behaviour is mainly attributable to the ephemeral characteristics of the river determining quality model parameter values much higher than those presented in literature for permanent rivers.",URBAN WATER JOURNAL,5,2,,87,96,,10.1080/15730620701736878,,,,,,1573-062X,,WOS:000262437200001

M.; Hughes, Catherine E.; Hankin, S.; Cendon, Dioni I.; Hollins, Suzanne E.",Evaporative isotope enrichment as a constraint on reach water balance along a dryland river,"Deuterium and oxygen-18 enrichment in river water during its transit across dryland region is found to occur systematically along evaporation lines with slopes of close to 4 in H-2-O-18 space, largely consistent with trends predicted by the Craig-Gordon model for an open-water dominated evaporating system. This, in combination with reach balance assessments and derived runoff ratios, strongly suggests that the enrichment signal and its variability in the Barwon-Darling river, Southeastern Australia is acquired during the process of evaporation from the river channel itself, as enhanced by the presence of abundant weirs, dams and other storages, rather than reflecting inherited enrichment signals from soil water evaporation in the watershed. Using a steady-state isotope mass balance analysis based on monthly O-18 and H-2, we use the isotopic evolution of river water to re-construct a perspective of net exchange between the river and its contributing area along eight reaches of the river during a drought period from July 2002 to December 2003, including the duration of a minor flow event. The resulting scenario, which uses a combination of climatological averages and available real-time meteorological data, should be viewed as a preliminary test of the application rather than as a definitive inventory of reach water balance. As expected for a flood-driven dryland system, considerable temporal variability in exchange is predicted. While requiring additional real-time isotopic data for operational use, the method demonstrates potential as a non-invasive tool for detecting and quantifying water diversions, one that can be easily incorporated within existing water quality monitoring activities.",ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES,44,1,,83,98,,10.1080/10256010801887489,,International Workshop on the Isotope Effects in Evaportation,"MAY 03-05, 2006","Int Atom Energy Agcy; Univ Pisa; Weizmann Inst Sci, United Nations Educ Sci; Int Assoc Hydrolog Sci","Natl Council Res, Inst Geosci & Geosources, Pisa, ITALY",1025-6016,,WOS:000253731000009

Unpredictable, extreme climatic events (e.g. droughts) can potentially destabilize aquatic communities. From 1998 to 2002, southwestern Georgia, U.S.A., experienced the third worst drought of the last 100 years, leading to loss of surface flow in many small streams. We sampled macroinvertebrates, flow and water chemistry in small headwater streams from 2001 to 2007 in two adjacent coastal plain streams of contrasting headwater type (wetland and groundwater-fed seep) following resumption of flow.2. Decreasing water temperature, conductivity and nutrient concentrations within the first 2 years of the study indicated flushing of the streambed associated with increased discharge. Invertebrate community composition became less variable over time and during wetter years, reflecting water chemistry, hydrological and climate conditions.3. A core set of species appeared immediately following breaking of the drought in both streams, reflecting a shared species pool. These species exhibited resilience traits, including short life cycles and resistance to desiccation, which allowed for rapid recovery from disturbance. Such species, which were small-bodied, sclerotized and abundant in the drift, were then replaced as flows increased by those that were larger, soft-bodied and rare in drift, suggesting a more stable and less ephemeral habitat.4. Hydrologic regime and long-term precipitation indices were strongly correlated with invertebrate community and trait structure. Long-term data allowed for better interpretation of the effects of infrequent disturbances on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, long-term precipitation indices (i.e. 48-month standardized precipitation index) can indicate the likelihood of a return to drought, allowing for the collection of pre-disturbance data.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,53,12,,2465,2483,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02067.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000260670100011

We investigated the responses of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes to the hydrogeomorphic template in the riparian zone of the San Pedro River, Arizona, a large (catchment area similar to 11,500 km(2)), free-flowing, semiarid river. Over an annual period we documented spatial and temporal patterns in soil, shallow groundwater, and stream nutrient chemistry as well as rates of N-transforming processes in soils of the surface (0-17 cm) and region of seasonal saturation (RoSS). A hot moment of N retention and removal was indicated by elevated rates of microbial processes during the summer monsoon season. At the same time, elevated C was observed in soil microbial biomass for both surface soils and soils in the RoSS. Analyses of C-use profiles for soil microbes, coupled with trends in stream and shallow-groundwater chemistry, further suggest that this hot moment of N removal was fueled by newly available, labile organic material. In a spatial context, patchiness in soil resources, microbial biomass, and potential denitrification were best explained by variation in microtopography; low-elevation landscape positions were hot spots of resource availability and microbial activity. Vertical heterogeneity also corresponded with variation in the factors influencing N transformation rates. Organic matter was more frequently a significant factor explaining N transformation rates in RoSS soils whereas soil water content was more often important in surface soils. Together, these patterns suggest that understanding the points on the hydrogeomorphic template, both in space and in time, that bring together water and labile organic matter will lead to greater predictive capability regarding C and N cycling in semiarid river-riparian corridors.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,113,G1,,,,G01020,10.1029/2007JG000588,,,,,,0148-0227,,WOS:000254166100002
Biogeochemistry,2008,"Heffernan, James B.; Sponseller, Ryan A.; Fisher, Stuart G.",Consequences of a biogeomorphic regime shift for the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream,"1. Feedbacks between vegetation and geomorphic processes can generate alternative stable states and other nonlinear behaviours in ecological systems, but the consequences of these biogeomorphic interactions for other ecosystem processes are poorly understood. In this study, we describe the changes in the hydrological, geomorphic and biogeochemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran desert stream (Sycamore Creek, Arizona, U.S.A.) in response to a transition from an unvegetated gravel-bed state to densely vegetated wetlands (cienegas).2. A survey of the entire length of Sycamore Creek indicated that cienegas occupied c. 18% of the stream, and were disproportionately represented in constrained canyons rather than wide, unconstrained valleys.3. Vegetated patches were characterized by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate and high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the hyporheic zone. In contrast to unvegetated areas, hyporheic DO in cienegas exhibited no relationship with vertical hydraulic gradients.4. Increases in hyporheic DO following removal of vegetation by floods supports the hypothesis that these reduced conditions were the result of biogeochemical and geomorphic changes associated with vegetation establishment. In locations where vegetation persisted, hyporheic DO exhibited no response to flooding; in sections where vegetation was removed hyporheic DO closely tracked post-flood increases in surface stream DO.5.Shallow sediments in vegetated patches were finer and more organic-rich than in unvegetated patches, due to increased deposition during floods. Conservative tracer additions indicated that hydrological exchange between the surface stream and hyporheic zone was much lower in cienegas than in gravel-bed reaches.6. Vegetation establishment in desert streams not only alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone, but also the nature of interactions between surface and hyporheic subsystems.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,53,10,,1954,1968,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02019.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000259148200004

These basins lie adjacent to each other and differ in their hydrological inputs and riverine structure, providing an ideal opportunity to identify the impact of landscape processes upon population dynamics of freshwater fish.3. Populations were strongly structured among basins, among catchments within basins and were weakly structured within catchments in the Lake Eyre Basin, providing support for the Stream Hierarchy Model.4. Interestingly, mtDNA and microsatellite diversity was much higher in the Gulf of Carpentaria Basin compared to the Lake Eyre Basin.

The imminent damming of the Odelouca River, an intermittent Mediterranean river situated in the south-west Algarve region of Portugal with valuable stands of riparian vegetation, has called for the compulsory implementation of compensatory measures.2. In order to assess the primary environmental and human factors that drive change in the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of the Odelouca, and the spatial scale at which they occur, 30 sites were sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates and extensively surveyed using River Habitat Survey (RHS) in spring 2005.3. A hierarchical cluster analysis of selected physical and RHS variables clearly indicated gradients of habitat quality (instream and riparian corridor) along both main channel and tributaries. Analysis of macroinvertebrate metrics by parametric and non-parametric ANOVA showed the derived clusters of groups to be biologically distinct.4. From a total of 64 variables, divided into two explanatory variable groups (environmental or pressure) over three spatial scales (habitat, reach and basin), just 20, predominantly environmental, variables were retained for subsequent analyses.5. Partial canonical correspondence analyses of the selected environmental and pressure variables over the defined spatial scales showed that environmental variables contributed most significantly over all of the spatial scales and that pressure variables related to land-use only contributed significantly at the level of the river basin.6. Variables recorded by RHS contribute successfully to the detection of habitat quality gradients in a Mediterranean river system and the strongest drivers of macroinvertebrate change are primarily, but not exclusively, environmental factors occurring at middle and higher spatial scales.7. Compensatory measures must therefore be implemented across a range of spatial scales, taking into account abiotic and biotic processes characteristic of disturbance-driven Mediterranean systems that contribute to habitat heterogeneity and quality and confer functional and trophic diversity to the macroinvertebrate assemblages.

A hierarchical cluster analysis reveals that the three islands have different species compositions with Curacao being the most diverse, probably due to its having the most habitats and freshwaters present throughout the year. Species richness was unrelated to salinity and species diversity was highest in canalised streams. In the dry season fewer amphidromous species are present than in the wet season.

This study examined the responses of zooplankton through a wetting and drying cycle in a complex floodplain-wetland system in semi-arid Australia, the Narran Lakes. We illustrate the complexity of the zooplankton ""boom"" and ""bust"" response. Total densities of zooplankton varied considerably over time and patterns were very dissimilar between sites with abundances varying from < 30 animals/L to over 4000 animals/L. We detected different patterns in the proportion of variance in abundances of the broad taxonomic groups (rotifers, cladocerans, ostracods, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods and nauplii) explained by time and space. Site explained the highest proportion of variation in cladoceran and ostracod abundances,whereas variance in calanoid abundances was explained predominantly by time since inundation. Variation in the abundances of the remaining groups was explained largely by the site by time interaction. Zooplankton assemblages were observed to diverge during drying with highest between-site dissimilarities in assemblage structure occurring during the later stages of drying. Such high spatial and temporal variability in zooplankton abundances and community composition could have important consequences for consumers such as fish and some wetland birds that utilize these ephemeral systems for feeding and breeding while they are inundated.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,70,3,,259,271,,10.1007/s00027-008-8034-0,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000258704000005
Fish,2008,"Leigh, Catherine; Sheldon, Fran",HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES AND ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE FLOODPLAIN RIVERS IN THE AUSTRALIAN TROPICS,"The majority of rivers in the Australian tropics possess near-natural flow regimes and are an ecological asset of global significance. We examined flow variability in large floodplain rivers in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, and the potential ecological impacts of future water resource development (WRD). Flow metrics based on long-term records were used to classify flow regimes and predict hydrological drivers of ecological function. Flow regimes of selected rivers were then compared with those simulated for pre- and post-WRD flows in the Darling River, a highly modified river in Australia's south-east. Generally, rivers were classified as typically 'tropical' (more permanent, regular flows) or 'dryland' (more ephemeral, with greater flow variability). In addition, all rivers displayed wet-dry seasonality associated with changes in flow magnitude or number of zero-flow days. We propose that these features (flow permanence and regularity; flow variability and absence; wet-dry seasonality) are the key hydrological drivers of biodiversity and ecological function in the floodplain rivers of Australia's north. In terms of WRD, inter-annual flow variability was predicted to increase or decrease depending on rivers' natural flow regimes, specifically their tendency toward lower or higher flow magnitudes. Either outcome is expected to have adverse effects on the biodiversity and ecological function of these relatively pristine rivers and floodplain habitats. In particular, reduced and homogenized habitat, loss of life-history cues, inhibited dispersal and shifts in community composition, as a result of WRD, threaten the ecological integrity of rivers adapted to the three hydrological drivers above. These findings serve as a caution for careful consideration of WRD options for rivers in the Australian tropics and for those with similar flow regimes the world over.

While theory predicts how populations should evolve under different degrees of disturbance predictability, there is little empirical evidence of how this occurs in nature. Here, we demonstrate local adaptation in populations of an aquatic insect occupying sites along a natural gradient of disturbance predictability, where predictability was defined as the ability of a proximate cue (rainfall) to signal a disturbance (flash flood). In controlled behavioural experiments, populations from predictable environments responded to rainfall events by quickly exiting the water and moving sufficiently far from the stream to escape flash floods. By contrast, populations from less predictable environments had longer response times and lower response rates, reflecting the uncertainty inherent to these environments. Analysis with signal detection theory showed that for 13 out of 15 populations, observed response times were an optimal compromise between the competing risks of abandoning versus remaining in the stream, mediated by the rainfall-flood correlation of the local environment.

Nine stations were chosen along the Arc stream (three stations downstream from an organic effluent and one station upstream from the pollution source) and on two groups of tributaries (three intermittent and two perennial). High biodiversity erosion was noticed in the main stem, revealing diffuse sources of pollution added to the expected effect of the localized organic pollution. Jackknife richness estimator and beta diversity indicated that the intermittent tributaries had the highest richness values and harboured 70% of the taxa recorded at the catchment scale. The intermittent flow tributaries seem to play a major role in maintaining the taxonomic richness in such catchments, highly impacted by anthropogenic activities.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Index of Biotic Integrity approach (IBI) with fish assemblages in the Guadiana catchment, a typical Mediterranean watershed in Southern Portugal. Reference sites were selected from a set of 95 sites, using a multivariate approach. Fifty-five candidate metrics were screened for range, responsiveness, precision and redundancy. Final metrics included: proportion of native fish, number of intolerant and intermediate species, number of invertivore native fish, number of phyto-lithophilic and polyphilic species, and catches of exotics. The IBI scores correlated with composite gradients of human impact and differed significantly between reference and non-reference sites. Application of the IBI to an independent validation set with 123 sites produced results congruent with the development set and repeatable assessments at 22 sites showed concordance in IBI scoring.

Low topography and large-scale flooding events make it possible that connectivity events may have occurred between the drainages throughout history.

Both species showed significant divergence across the drainage divide. There was evidence of two fragmentation events in the N. erebi data and divergence estimates for these events were 160 000 and 350 000 years ago.

In streams, spatial hotspots of nutrient transformations are generally attributed to physical and microbial processes. Here we examine the potential for heterogeneous distributions of. sh to generate hotspots of nutrient recycling. We measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) excretion rates of 47 species of fish in an N-limited Neotropical stream, and we combined these data with population densities in each of 49 stream channel units to estimate unit-and reach-scale nutrient recycling. Species varied widely in rates of N and P excretion as well as excreted N: P ratios (6 -176 molar). At the reach scale, fish excretion could meet > 75% of ecosystem demand for dissolved inorganic N and turn over the ambient NH4 pool in < 0.3 km. Areal N excretion estimates varied 47-fold among channel units, suggesting that. sh distributions could influence local N availability. P excretion rates varied 14-fold among units but were low relative to ambient concentrations. Spatial variation in aggregate nutrient excretion by fish reflected the effects of habitat characteristics (depth, water velocity) on community structure (body size, density, species composition), and the preference of large-bodied species for deep runs was particularly important. We conclude that the spatial distribution of. sh could indeed create hotspots of nutrient recycling during the dry season in this species-rich tropical stream. The prevalence of patchy distributions of stream. sh and invertebrates suggests that hotspots of consumer nutrient recycling may often occur in stream ecosystems.",ECOLOGY,69,89,8,2335,2346,,10.1890/07-1552.1,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000258236400027
Biogeochemistry,2008,"McLaughlin, Christine","Evaporation as a nutrient retention mechanism at Sycamore Creek, Arizona","Studies of nutrient cycling in streams have typically focused on patterns and mechanisms of retention because retention can result in temporary or permanent removal of biologically important nutrients. Biogeochemical studies of nitrate in stream ecosystems have focused primarily on biotic uptake and sequestration, while little is known about abiotic mechanisms of nitrogen retention. Evaporation is one abiotic mechanism that can contribute to nutrient retention with nutrients stored as precipitated solutes in sandbars. The objective of this study was to assess the significance of evaporation-driven nitrate retention in sandbars to reach-scale nutrient budgets at Sycamore Creek, Arizona. The vertical profile of chloride and nitrate evaporties were used as a tool to evaluate abiotic retention. I found that salts accumulated in surface layers (0-2 cm) of exposed sandbar sediments. Calculated evaporative retention rate was 0.7-5.4% of average rate of uptake by biota in the surface stream. However, the area of influence of these two mechanisms varies greatly. Taking into account this spatial and seasonal variation in areal extent of the surface stream versus exposed sandbar surfaces, evaporite formation accounted for 14.8% of retention in the study reach and up to 46.0% of annual retention compared to instream biotic uptake. Nitrate retention via evaporation is important because of the temporary disconnection of nutrients stored in sandbars to the surface stream delaying further biological processing until hydrological reconnection occurs.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,603,,,241,252,,10.1007/s10750-007-9275-y,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000254088900018

Despite a low dissolved oxygen (DO, range = 0.4?6.8 mg L?1) and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 16?50 mg L?1) concentrations, assemblage composition and abundance of native fish appeared unaffected. In subsequent laboratory experiments, concentrations of DO and DOC were independently manipulated to identify better the tolerance of these species to extremes in environmental conditions. At low DOC concentrations (20 mg L?1), no significant effects were observed. At high DOC concentrations (50, 70 and 80 mg L?1), an interaction was observed between DOC and DO, with significant reductions in resistance (decreased time to loss of buoyancy). At extreme DOC concentrations (99 mg L?1), the effect of DO appeared to have been overridden by a strong effect from DOC (rapid loss of equilibrium). The thresholds observed suggest these species have a high resistance to ?blackwater events? caused by leaching of DOC from terrestrial leaf litter.

This study evaluates the importance of zooplankton to the diets of three species of fish living in floodplain waterholes of an Australian dryland river. The species selected for study represent different trophic categories in waterhole food webs: Ambassis agassizii is a microcarnivore, Leiopotherapon unicolor is an omnivore, and Nematalosa erebi is a detritivore. Dietary differences among size classes of each species were also evaluated to understand possible ontogenetic shifts in zooplankton consumption. Ambassis agassizii fed primarily on zooplankton (99.9%, made up mostly of 81.6% Calanoida and 17.4% Moinidae), regardless of the size of individual fish. Leiopotherapon unicolor fed on zooplankton (47%, mostly Daphniidae and Moinidae) and aquatic insects (46.7%). Smaller individuals of Leiopotherapon unicolor (30-49 mm TL-total length) were responsible for 36.1% of the plankton consumed by the species. Nematalosa erebi fed on detritus (84.6%) with zooplankton (Calanoida, Moinidae, and Cyclopoida) contributing only 13.7% of the mean diet. Smaller individuals (40-69 mm TL) were responsible for 98% of the plankton consumed by Nematalosa erebi, and individuals of 40-49 mm (TL) fed exclusively on zooplankton (53.8% Moinidae and 46.2% Calanoida). Although the three fish species had different diets, reflecting differences in species-specific and ontogenetic morphological and behavioral characteristics, zooplankton formed the basis of the diet of all species when young.

Biogeochemistry,2008,"Mencio, Anna; Mas-Pla, Josep",Assessment by multivariate analysis of groundwater-surface water interactions in urbanized Mediterranean streams,"Streams in Mediterranean areas are characterized by a variable discharge regime with annual floods and droughts. Natural flow perturbations result in permanent and temporary rivers and, as a consequence, unique ecosystems. Human pressures such as treated and non-treated waste water discharge impact severely on these streams, since waste water dilution depends on river flow dynamics. Furthermore, their hydrological status worsens with the capture of stream discharge by surface or groundwater exploitation.Multivariate analysis has been widely used to analyze large sets of variables in environmental studies. In the present work, a hydrological study reinforced by principal component analysis (PCA), followed by cluster analysis of the PCA results, has been used to determine surface water origin and its interactions with groundwater in Mediterranean streams.The results show that hydrological observations are supported by PCA and cluster analysis. Additionally, this joint analysis makes it possible to observe the significance of the interaction between streams and aquifers in anthropized Mediterranean Basins. Groundwater exploitation can seriously impact on permanent streams, reducing their dilution capacity, and can even cause the capture of the whole stream discharge. Furthermore, good quality water contributions allow continuous stream flows and better waste water dilutions all year long. Finally, the results show that the presence and quality of surface water in temporary reaches during dry periods directly depends on groundwater contributions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Mediterranean streams are characterized by natural seasonal disturbances, a high capability of resistance and resilience, and high diversity and endemism, which may reduce the establishment of invaders. One example of freshwater invasive species in Mediterranean streams is Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a grazing mud-snail which arrived in Europe in the late 19th century from New Zealand. We studied the effects during one year of the invasion of P antipodarum on macroinvertebrate community structure at two different scales along a pollution gradient in a small Mediterranean catchment at the Iberian Peninsula. At reach scale, we analyzed environmental tolerance of P. antipodarum, changes of macroinvertebrate community structure along the stream, and chlorophylla standing stocks in field experiments. At microhabitat scale, we assessed how the abundance of R antipodarum was mediated by biotic and abiotic factors. The abundance of P. antipodarum along the pollution gradient showed a unimodal distribution, being higher at intermediate impaired conditions. Sites with a dominance of P. antipodarum did not necessarily have a different taxonomical structure than sites without it. The effect of P. antipodarum on chlorophyll-a standing stocks was not significant. At microhabitat scale, both the biotic (competition with other taxa) and abiotic (flow velocity and substrate) factors are supposed to interfere with the abundance of P antipodarum generating structural differences among microhabitats. Our results show that P antipodarum had relatively high abundances in Our stream but with relatively low impact, what strongly contrasts to some western US studies. Its weak effect on community structure suggested low abilities of R antipodarum to get higher densities in the harsh hydrologic condition of Mediterranean streams characterized by seasonal droughts and floods.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,171,2,,131,143,,10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0171-0131,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000256527600004

The dilution-mixing model is widely used for this purpose in tributary channel systems that transport contaminants as bed-material load without significant overbank sedimentation. Here a more general, three-dimensional (3D) contaminant transport numerical model is developed and tested based on bed scour, turbulent mixing of contaminant material with uncontaminated channel-bed sediments, and re-deposition of the mixture by the cumulative effect of many flood events. First, the model is applied to a synthetic alluvial-fan environment downstream from a localized contaminant source in order to illustrate the model behavior. Second, the model is validated against measured tephra concentrations in channels downstream from the Lathrop Wells scoria cone volcano, a localized source of basaltic tephra to downstream channels otherwise comprised of non-basaltic sediments. Third, the model is applied to the problem of predicting the concentration of radionuclide-bound tephra in channels downstream from the proposed nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, in the event of a volcanic eruption through the repository. Contaminated tephra is mobilized from the landscape in this model using threshold criteria for hillslope gradient and channel stream power. Mobilized contaminated tephra is mixed with uncontaminated channel-bed sediments using the contaminant transport model and deposited in channels of the Fortymile Wash alluvial fan where the residents nearest to the proposed repository live. The results of twenty Monte Carlo simulations of eruption fallout and post-eruption redistribution corresponding to a range of wind conditions and eruption magnitudes provide information on the mean and variability of contaminated tephra concentrations to be expected in channels of the Fortymile Wash alluvial fan in the event of an eruption. Mean tephra concentrations are approximately 1% but vary from nearly zero to as high as 26%, reflecting the combined effects of wind direction, eruption magnitude, and dilution of tephra with uncontaminated channel-bed sediments during transport.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2008,"Rassam, D. W.; Pagendam, D. E.; Hunter, H. M.",Conceptualisation and application of models for groundwater-surface water interactions and nitrate attenuation potential in riparian zones,"Riparian zones can provide a protective buffer between streams and adjacent land-based activities, by removing nitrate from shallow ground-water flowing through them. Catchment scale water quality models are useful tools for predicting catchment behaviour under various climatic conditions and land use scenarios, but most do not account for the effect of riparian buffer zones. In this paper, we present conceptual models for surface water-groundwater interactions and formulate analytical mathematical functions that describe nitrate removal in the riparian zone. We restrict nitrate attenuation capacity to potential denitrification only and present sample calculations based on the limited field data available. The models are classed into two types according to their applicability to either ephemeral or perennial streams. In ephemeral, low-order streams with the potential to form a perched water table, a simple bucket model is used. During events, stream water flows laterally into the riparian zone and may be denitrified while residing there before discharging back to the surface water system. In perennial middle-order streams, nitrate removal may occur either as base flow intercepts the root zone or when water is temporarily stored in stream banks during flood events. We incorporate these concepts within a GIS modelling framework and investigate the potential of riparian zones to reduce nitrate delivery to streams in the Maroochy catchment located in South East Queensland, Australia. The modelling results for the Maroochy catchment show that the optimum rooting depth is about 4 m and that increasing the riparian buffer width beyond 10 m yields little further reduction in nitrate. The potential nitrate removal capacity per unit length of riparian buffer in each sub-catchment is an attribute that can be used to help to prioritise riparian rehabilitation activities aimed at reducing stream nitrogen loads.

S.; Reich, Paul",Terrestrial detritus supports the food webs in lowland intermittent streams of south-eastern Australia: a stable isotope study,"1. Large amounts of terrestrial detritus enter many low-order forested streams, and this organic material is often the major basal resource in the metazoan food webs of such systems. However, despite their apparently low biomass, algae are the dominant food of organisms in a number of aquatic communities which conventionally would have been presumed to be dependent on allochthonous detritus, particularly those in the tropics and also in lowland intermittent streams in arid Australia.2. The dual stable isotope signatures (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of potential primary food sources were compared with the isotopic signatures of common aquatic animals in lowland intermittent streams in south-eastern Australia, in both spring and summer, to determine whether allochthonous detritus was an important nutritional resource in these systems. The isotopic signatures of the major potential allochthonous plant food sources (Eucalyptus, Phalaris and Juncus) overlapped, but were distinct from algae and the dominant macrophytes growing in the study reaches. The isotopic signatures of biofilm were more spatially and temporally variable than those of the other basal resources.3. Despite allochthonous detritus having relatively high C : N ratios compared to other potential basal resources, results from isosource mixing model calculations demonstrated that this detritus, and the associated biofilm, were the major energy sources assimilated by macroinvertebrate primary consumers in both spring and summer. The importance of these energy sources was also reflected in animals higher in the food web, including predatory macroinvertebrates and fish. These resources were supplemented by autochthonous sources of higher nutritional value (i.e. filamentous algae and macrophytes, which had relatively low C : N ratios) when they became more prolific as the streams dried to disconnected pools in summer.4. The results highlight the importance of allochthonous detritus (particularly from Eucalyptus) as a dependable energy source for benthic macroinvertebrates and fish in lowland intermittent streams of south-eastern Australia. This contrasts with previous stable isotope studies conducted in lowland intermittent streams in arid Australia, which have reported that the fauna are primarily dependent on autochthonous algae.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,53,10,,2036,2050,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02025.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000259148200010

Springs originated from silicate or carbonate geologies and were near or above treeline. One iron- sulphur and three temporary springs were also included in the study. Ecosystem function was assessed in four springs via measures of bacterial abundance, sediment respiration, nutrient uptake, and ecosystem metabolism. Food webs were assessed in all 20 springs using nutrient content ( C, N, P) and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Bacteria counts ranged from 1.8 to 3.4 x 108 cells mL- 1 sediment with no significant differences between sites. Sediment respiration rates ranged from 0.13 to 0.46 mg O2 h- 1 and did not differ between springs. Uptake lengths for N ranged from 11 to 63 m, and for phosphorus from 4 to 60 m. Nitrogen uptake rates ( U) ranged from 57 to 266 mu g m- 2 h- 1 and those for P from 0.11 to 4.2 mu gm- 2 h- 1. Gross primary production ( GPP) ranged from 0.7 to 7.1 g O2m- 2 d- 1, but reached values of 59.1 - 70.9 g O2m- 2 d- 1 in the iron- sulphur spring. Ecosystem respiration ( ER) ranged from 1.3 to 10.3 g O2m- 2 d- 1, but was 91.1 - 101.8 g O2m- 2 d- 1 in the ironsulphur spring. All four springs were net- heterotrophic with production to respiration ratios ( P/ R) ranging from 0.48 to 0.72. The percentage C, N, and P varied significantly among the different food web compartments. The molar ratios ( C: P, C: N, N: P) of the different nutrients were consistent within compartments, although varying among the different compartments. Stable isotope signatures ( delta 13C, delta 15N) were related to the specific spring types, although food webs were relatively simple with most benthic invertebrates showing omnivory. Riparian spiders partially used aquatic insects in the diet. The results suggest that these alpine springs are complex but functionally similar to forested headwater streams with simple food webs.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,70,4,,432,445,,10.1007/s00027-008-8125-y,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000261329000008

To date freshwater aquatic ecosystems have seldom been considered in this process. How much of a difference does it make when they are considered as well?This study examined the conservation of riverine biodiversity within 17 assessment units contained by the catchment areas of five perennial rivers flowing through Kruger National Park and two seasonal rivers that are largely contained within this park. Physical river types, fish species and invertebrate families or genera were used as surrogates of riverine biodiversity. Conservation planning software was used to select an optimal set of planning units to represent and maintain riverine biodiversity.The current spatial configuration of Kruger National Park, largely an accident of history, is particularly poor when assessed against the objective of conserving riverine biodiversity. Several alternative layouts are examined. These options are theoretical since there is little current opportunity to reassign land uses in the region. This study shows that substantially improved layouts for both riverine and terrestrial biodiversity are possible, under the constraint of the same total area under protection. The study also shows that even these optimal layouts are only partially successful in efforts to conserve fully representative samples of riverine biodiversity. Because of the longitudinal connectivity of rivers, conservation strategies that extend beyond protected areas are essential. Explicit conservation visions, targets and strategies need to be included in integrated water resource management plans.Based on the results of this study, nine recommendations are provided for increasing the effectiveness of current and future protected areas in conserving riverine biodiversity. These are to use systematic conservation planning to make biodiversity benefits explicit; mend the disconnect between terrestrial and freshwater conservation; use multiple surrogates wherever possible; be strategic about the collection and management of primary data; strive for maximum hydrologic connectivity; resist development pressure; foster good relationships across park fences; where relevant, pursue multi-national cooperation at the basin scale; and engage the value debate and resolve awareness and capacity constraints.

Assessment,2008,"Rupp, David E.; Larned, Scott T.; Arscott, David B.; Schmidt, Jochen",Reconstruction of a daily flow record along a hydrologically complex alluvial river,"Complex spatial and temporal flow patterns in alluvia( plain rivers can be caused by variation in groundwater surface-water exchange, channel planform, and climatic variation. Such complexity poses a challenge for developing relationships between runoff, groundwater recharge, and river flow, for predicting effects of water resource developments, and for understanding hydrologic effects on ecological processes. The Selwyn River of New Zealand is one such hydrologically complex river. To begin to understand the spatio-temporal flow patterns of the Selwyn River, we used linear and logistic models to reconstruct a 22-yr record of river flow across the alluvial Canterbury Plains. The 60 km - long model domain encompasses perennial, ephemeral, and intermittent reaches embedded within Larger effluent and influent sections. Flow at 18 cross-sections distributed along the river mainstem was modelled as a function of flow at stage recorders Located at each end of the domain with flow interpolated between cross-sections to generate a flow record continuous in space. Data from 38-months of flow-gauging at the cross-sections was used to calibrate model parameters. The reconstructed record indicates that white the central section of the river was dry during most of the 38-month observation period, it was not uncommon during the preceding two decades for the river to flow along its entire course for several months consecutively. The recent dry period may be part of a Longer trend: the mean annual simulated Length of dry river channel has increased by 0.6 km yr(-1) over the last two decades. Output metrics from the model can increase our understanding of hydrologic control of ecological processes in alluvial rivers. We provide several examples of potential model applications to ecological studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A comparison of Mediterranean and Atlantic streams,"Climate affects many aspects of stream ecosystems, although the presence of riparian forests can buffer differences between streams in different climatic settings. In an attempt to measure the importance of climate, we compared the seasonal patterns of hydrology, input and storage of allochthonous organic matter, and the trophic structure (abundance of algae and macroinvertebrates) in two temperate forested streams, one Mediterranean, the other Atlantic. Hydrology played a leading role in shaping the trophic structure of both streams. Frequency and timing of floods and droughts determined benthic detritus storage. Inputs and retention of allochthonous organic matter were higher in the Atlantic stream, whereas chlorophyll concentration was lower because of stronger light limitation. Instead, light availability and scour of particulate organic matter during late winter favoured higher chlorophyll concentration in the Mediterranean stream. As a result, in the Mediterranean stream grazers were more prevalent and consumers showed a higher dependence on autotrophic materials. On the other hand, the Atlantic stream depended on allochthonous materials throughout the whole study period. The overall trophic structure showed much stronger seasonality in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic stream, this being the most distinctive difference between these two types of temperate streams. The different patterns observed in the two streams are an indication that climatic differences should be incorporated in proper measurements of ecosystem health. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeochemistry,2008,"Salles, Christian; Tournoud, Marie George; Chu, Yin",Estimating nutrient and sediment flood loads in a small Mediterranean river,"Various methods were evaluated for estimating the loads of total suspended sediments and particulate associated and dissolved nutrients during floods. The six selected methods were compared using field data from two carefully sampled floods at the outlet of a small Mediterranean catchment. Water samples were available during floods at short time intervals (i.e. from 1 to 6 It time steps) and discharge was measured every 5 min. In the first step, the load estimators were compared on the basis of available data. Despite a fine description of the species concentration, there were significant differences in load estimates between the six methods. In the second step the sampling sensitivity of the methods was compared. For the two floods, 3000 random sub-samples were generated from Monte Carlo simulations. The estimates derived from the random sub-samples were compared to the load estimated by using the entire record. The results show that bias and precision are affected by the sample size and the transport phase of the species. Generally speaking, two methods allow reliable load estimation as long as a detailed water flow and at least three to four samples per day are available.

Assessment,2008,"Shaw, Jeremy R.; Cooper, David J.","Linkages among watersheds, stream reaches, and riparian vegetation in dryland ephemeral stream networks","Ephemeral streams are common features of landscapes around the world, and are the predominant fluvial. environment in and zones. Current understanding of dryland riparian ecology is derived primarily from perennial stream environments, and little is known about the factors controlling vegetation along ephemeral streams. This study describes relationships between the physical characteristics of watersheds and stream reaches, and their effects on riparian plant communities, for 14 ephemeral stream reaches in the semi-arid southern Colorado Plateau, USA. Interactions of watershed properties produce gradients of hydro-geomorphic regimes throughout stream networks, which give rise to spatial patterns in the structure and composition of perennial woody plant and grass dominated communities. As watershed and network magnitudes increased, and basin slope decreased, stream reaches exhibited reduced erosive capacities and more attenuated alluvial groundwater variability. Decreased disturbance potential and increased moisture availability in the downstream direction was related to greater abundance of obligate riparian taxa, and increasing structural importance of shrub and tree species. Divisions in watershed and stream reach physical properties corresponded with riparian plant community types, implying that progress in dryland fluvial. ecology could be made from research within a watershed or network context. These concepts are integrated to form a stream classification system that describes functional linkages between watersheds, stream reaches, and riparian plant ecology. Type I streams drain watersheds less than 10 km(2), exhibit the greatest disturbance potential and most xeric alluvial groundwater regime, and are occupied by upland plant associations. Type II streams have watersheds between 10 and 100 km(2), and have more moderate shear stresses and more persistent alluvial groundwater. Plant communities consisting of a mix of upland and riparian species occur in Type II reaches. Type III reaches drain watersheds of more than 100 km(2) and hydrologic regimes are controlled mainly by upstream hydro-climatic conditions. These streams have the lowest bankfull, shear stresses and perennial water tables that span expansive floodplains. Wetland tree and shrub communities dominate Type III reaches, and upland plants are a minor ecological component. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Elevated concentrations of nitrates and salts in river water as well as nutrients and heavy metals in river sediments have been attributed to agricultural land uses and practices and point sources of organic pollution. A scheme for the classification of the river's chemical status (within the ecological quality classification procedure) was applied by combining pollution parameters in groups according to related pressures. In light of the temporal hydrological regime and anthropogenic impacts, sediment chemical quality elements were considered, in addition to hydrochemical ones. Despite the extensive agricultural activities in the basin, the majority of the sites examined showed a good quality and only three of them were classified as moderate.

N. erebi diets reflected strong 'boom and bust' patterns of food consumption, with high concentrations of benthic (non-filamentous) algae during boom (flow) times, moving to higher concentrations of filamentous algae and detritus during bust (no flow) periods. M. ambigua diets were primarily dominated by aquatic insects in all sampling periods. Although there was no clear 'boom to bust' pattern in relation to flow, M. ambigua secondary prey consumption revealed a compensatory switch between high energy prey (crustaceans) during more productive periods with terrestrial insects during less productive periods. The ability of both species of fish to switch from high to low concentrations of food quality under a variable environmental background allows them to persist through both high productive and low productive periods. This interaction between native biota and variable 'boom' and 'bust' conditions, and how changes to the natural hydrology will affect it is an important consideration of any future water resource development plans.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,59,2,,137,144,,10.1071/MF07125,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000253530500004

Community composition changed progressively during the autumn-to-spring flow period (March-November 2005) at one intermittent headwater site, but at the other two sites a directional change was not evident, probably because stream flow stopped briefly several times during the flow period. Most of the taxa collected in riffles during the flow period were also in disconnected pools after flow stopped in summer (January 2006), but some taxa were absent and the disconnected pools contained several additional species. The disconnected pools in January had higher macroinvertebrate density and richness than connected pools during the flow period. At intermittent sites with perennial headwaters, taxon richness and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness were intermediate between intermittent headwater sites and perennial streams.

It lies in the north-western part of Botswana where about 25,000 people reside across a number of widely scattered villages and informal settlements. The river, with its seasonal streams and pans, is vital to the livelihoods of these people, their livestock, and the wildlife that share this physical space. A combination of factors has led to widespread degradation of the physical resource base - both in the river bed itself and in the wider environment. As part of its outreach role, the Harry Oppeheimer Okavango Research Centre has undertaken a multi-year project along the Boteti River to assist people there with the rehabilitation of their resource base. The globally influential concept of integrated water resources management (IWRM) provides the analytical framework, in particular its emphasis on dialogue and stakeholder participation. The project has three primary aspects: facilitation of a dialogue platform; action-research: outreach and information dissemination. After two years of implementation, the project has collected a good deal of data and established a River Basin Forum with a common vision. However, the project continues to face difficulties in implementation: participation is limited; myths regarding resource degradation are difficult to dispel; meaningful communication among differently empowered actors is hard to achieve; and there are numerous human, financial and technological limitations. The primary researchers continue to alter their methods in the hope of achieving a functioning River Basin Committee (RBC), but observe that the globalized ideals of IWRM are, in this particular case at least, of limited use when attempting to alter localized management practices in basins with deeply embedded social and cultural practices.

Nutrient concentrations were measured monthly for 2 years within the bed sediments of a 300m reach located 20km downstream from the dam. Due to strong hydrological fluctuations hyporheic water was analysed during natural low and high water (HW) periods, and during water reservoir releases. Nutrient concentrations in surface water (SW) increased during water releases and in the HZ during the low water (LW) periods. Surface/hyporheic water interactions were characterized by determining the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and the chemical signature of the ground water (GW). The latter was obtained from regional GW monitoring. Hyporheic chemistry was strongly influenced by patterns of surface flow. Hyporheic and SWs had similar chloride concentrations during high flow when they were significantly lower than those of the regional GW. GW was generally richer in nitrates and nitrites, but was lower in ammonium concentrations than interstitial and river waters. Nitrates decreased significantly from upstream to downstream within the HZ throughout the hydrological period even though temporal fluctuations were high. Ammonium concentrations in interstitial water (IW) were significantly higher than in SW and generally increased from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates the importance of the HZ in altering the dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition and concentrations of heavily polluted arid streams.

We used monthly measurements over 2 years to examine variation in retention of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH(4)(+)) in two Mediterranean headwater streams with contrasting hydrological regimes (that is, perennial versus intermittent). Differences in retention between streams were more evident for NH(4)(+), likely due to strong differences in the potential for nitrogen limitation. In both streams, nutrient-retention efficiency was negatively influenced by abrupt discharge changes, whereas gradual seasonal changes in SRP demand were partially controlled by riparian vegetation dynamics through changes in organic matter and light availability. Nutrient concentrations were below saturation in the two streams; however, SRP demand increased relative to NH(4)(+) demand in the intermittent stream as the potential for phosphorus limitation increased (that is, higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen:SRP ratio). Unexpectedly, variability in nutrient retention was not greater in the intermittent stream, suggesting high resilience of biological communities responsible for nutrient uptake. Within-stream variability of all retention metrics, however, increased with increasing time scale. A review of studies addressing temporal variation of nutrient retention at different time scales supports this finding, indicating increasing variability of nutrient retention with concomitant increases in the variability of environmental factors from the diurnal to the inter-annual scale.

Assessment,2008,"Wang, Xixi; Yang, Wanhong",Modelling potential impacts of coalbed methane development on stream water quality in an American watershed,"Coalbed methane (CBM) development raises serious environmental concerns and concerted efforts have been made to collect chemistry, salinity, and sodicity data on CBM produced water. A model is sorely needed to make use of this data to quantify potential changes in stream water quality resulting from directly and/or indirectly receiving CBM produced water, on which little information is available in the literature. However, the application of existing hydrodynamic and water quality models such as CE-QUAL-W2 is not straightforward because the number of outfalls is usually large and the channels poorly defined for intermittent streams in semiarid areas such as the Powder River watershed, located in the states of Wyoming and Montana. Hence, the objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a CBM produced water routing (CBMPRO) model, and (2) apply the new CBMPRO model, along with a CE-QUAL-W2 model, to examine potential changes in stream water quality due to CBM development in the Powder River watershed. The CBMPRO model was developed and used to chart the CBM discharge and the transport of its associated constituents (e.g. total dissolved solids and alkalinity) from an outfall to its inclusive subwatershed outlet. In turn, the outputs from the CBMPRO model were applied as inputs into the CE-QUAL-W2 model to predict changes in the water quantity and quality along the Powder River mainstem. The results indicate that discharges from CBM developments adversely affect the stream water quality. Compared with the baseline conditions, the developments would increase the stream flows as well as make the stream water wanner and more saline. In addition, the impacts were predicted to undergo seasonal and spatial variations and to become smaller with time, as expected.

Benthic and drifting invertebrates also were collected to compare with cage assemblages at each stream. Colonization of cages was rapid at most sites with high total densities and biomass occurring within 3 days. Simpson's diversity was highest on day 3, and decreased and stabilized by day 8 in all stream types. Chironomids, simuliids, and the mayfly Baetis alpinus were common early colonizers of cages at most streams.

In the present paper, we aimed at assessing the response to disturbance of structural and functional components of the riparian ecosystem in order to develop a plant-based index of biotic integrity (Riparian Vegetation index, RVI). Further, the implications of Mediterranean conditions and the spatial scale dependency in the index performance and its component metrics were investigated and discussed. Aquatic and bankside plant species were sampled at more than 400 sites of Portuguese rivers, ill Spring-Summer of 2004 and 2005. Over 300 plant attributes were pre-screened to select 32 candidate metrics. Both single stressors and composite stressor indices were used in this Study. Two spatial scale-approaches were evaluated: the Local River Type - LRT - which follows the Portuguese river typology, and the Regional River Type - RRT -, which Clusters the LRT into North and South types. Composition (e.g. cover and number of alien and endemic species) and functional metrics associated with life cycle and reproduction (e.g. numbers of perennial species), or with trophic status (e.g. proportion of nitrophyllous species) were the most responsive to disturbance across types.

Assessment,2009,"Al Saud, M.","Watershed Characterization of Wadi Aurnah, Western Arabian Peninsula","The Western part of Arabian Peninsula constitutes a shield-like mega-structure, in which mountain chains are oriented in the NW-SE direction. Along this mountainous region, surface runoff is almost diverted towards the Red Sea in the west. Thus, several catchment topographic units exist to capture rainfall water among them. Even tough, the precipitation rate in the Western part of Arabian Peninsula is low (i.e. <200mm), yet a number of drainage systems occur and reveal empirical stream networking. However, studies belong to the watersheds located in the Western part of Arabian Peninsula are still rare and sometimes they show erroneous morphological characterization, notably in the catchments delineation. This is attributed mainly to the complicated drainage pattern, which is structurally-controlled. Thus, related morphological and hydrological studied obtained on these drainage systems reveal discreditable results and measures. This study aims to characterize Wadi Aurnah Watershed (~3113 km 2), which comprises a typical catchment in the Western part of Arabian Peninsula. In addition to topographic maps, remotely sensed data (ASTER and IKONOS satellite images) were utilized to delineate water divides with the most precision.

However, in urban areas, increased peak flows within streams lead to decreased retention of CPOM. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the reintroduction of CPOM, in the form of leaf litter, into a degraded urban stream would increase biofilm activity and phosphorus retention, two ecosystem functions that reflect the integrity of the ecosystem. Stream metabolism and nutrient retention were assessed in treated (T) and control (C) channels of the Torrens River Catchment, South Australia, before and after CPOM addition. Gross primary production and community respiration (CR) were measured as oxygen production and consumption within benthic chambers. Phosphorus retention was measured through a series of short-term filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) addition experiments. Before CPOM addition, there were no differences in CR, but C retained 6.8% more FRP than T. After CPOM addition, CR was greater in T than in C (572 and 276 mg O(2).m(-2).day(-1), respectively), and T retained 7.7% more FRP than C. The increase in FRP retention in T compared to C was attributed to phosphorus limitation of the CPOM and increased demand for phosphorus of the attached microbial heterotrophic community. The reintroduction of CPOM into degraded streams will be an important step in the restoration of stream metabolism and nutrient retention. Maintenance of CPOM may be achieved through restoration of riparian vegetation, a reduction in the increased peak flows, and rehabilitation of stream morphology.",RESTORATION ECOLOGY,17,1,,97,106,,10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00338.x,,,,,,1061-2971,,WOS:000262286700012
Invertebrate,2009,"Alvarez, Maruxa; Pardo, Isabel","Dynamics in the trophic structure of the macroinvertebrate community in a Mediterranean, temporary stream","Studies on the ecology of resource availability and its relation to hydrological regime are essential for aiding the understanding of stream functioning. This paper assesses the intrinsic role of potential food resources and hydrological variables in determining the functional structure of the macroinvertebrate community in a temporary, spring-fed stream. Quantitative estimates of food resources and aquatic macroinvertebrates, together with estimates of the hydrological variables, were collected during an annual surficial flow period. Standing stocks of benthic organic matter were moderately high (annual mean of 157.7 g AFDM m(-2)) and remained relatively constant over time. Moreover, allochthonous material was dominated by coarse material, reflecting the high retention but slow decomposition rates of Holm oak leaves, the major constituent of allochthonous inputs. Mean levels of periphyton biomass were high and decreased over the flow period (annual mean of 17 mg chl a m(-2)). The functional structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate community varied little over the study period and was consistently dominated by grazers and collectors. Conversely, predators and shredders were poorly represented and increased over the flow period. These observations were attributed to the impoverished invertebrate community that frequently characterizes temporary streams and the poor food quality associated with sclerophyllous leaf inputs at the beginning of the flow period. The small amplitude in discharge during most of the annual flow period and the high temperatures that distinguish the Mediterranean climate might allow algal food to be always available for consumers. This result may explain why autochthonous material was the most important food resource controlling food web dynamics in the studied temporary stream.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,71,2,,202,213,,10.1007/s00027-009-9160-z,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000267329600011

Microbial heterotrophic biomass (bacteria plus fungi) was generally higher than autotrophic biomass (algae), except during short periods of high light availability in the spring and winter. During these periods, sources of OM shifted towards autochthonous sources derived mainly from algae, which was demonstrated by high algal biomass and peptidase activity in benthic communities.3. Heterotrophic activity peaked in the autumn. Bacterial and fungal biomass increased with the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose compounds from leaf material. Later, lignin decomposition was stimulated in fine (sand, gravel) and coarse (rocks, boulders and cobbles) substrata by the accumulation of fine detritus.4.

Cooper Creek, an Australian dryland river, is characterised by extreme flow variability, especially in the magnitude, timing and duration of channel flows and floods, which, if they occur, do so mainly in summer. The present study examined the influence of hydrological variability on fish assemblages and abundance in four waterholes in the Windorah reach of Cooper Creek over eight occasions between 2001 and 2004. Antecedent flows had marked influences on fish species richness and assemblage structure. Following high summer flows, all waterholes supported a rich and abundant fish fauna, whereas fewer species and lower numbers were recorded following periods of zero channel flow. Recruitment of three of the four most common and abundant species was enhanced when intermittent flows inundated backwater and floodplain habitats that provide a food-rich environment. Opportunistic responses to rising channel flows and occasional large floods in Cooper Creek help to explain the prominent 'boom' patterns of fish production in this arid-zone river, whereas low-level recruitment during periods of low or no flow maintains populations of some species through the 'bust'.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,60,2,,146,159,,10.1071/MF08118,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000263526300005

S.; Ransley, T.; Baker, P.","Time-series measurements of stream and sediment temperature for understanding river-groundwater interactions: Border Rivers and Lower Richmond catchments, Australia","Monitoring of temperature in the stream sediment (0.25-1.2 m depth) as well as the stream itself was used to investigate groundwater-surface water interactions in two different Australian catchments (Border Rivers and Lower Richmond). When interpreted with hydrographic and hydraulic conductivity data, the temperature monitoring provided useful insights into the spatial and temporal variability of stream-aquifer connectivity. At one site, sediment temperatures fluctuated with the diurnal temperature variation of the stream, reflecting river leakage (losing conditions). No diurnal signal was detected in the sediment temperatures at other sites, which is a typical indicator of gaining conditions. However, with water-level measurements indicating negative gradients and the stream sediments dominated by clay at these sites, this lack of sediment temperature variability is interpreted to reflect very low rates of downward seepage. At one site, a transition from gaining to losing conditions was observed through time. In the field trials, operational issues such as timing the monitoring to coincide with reasonable diurnal variations of stream temperature, the requirement of understanding the shallow stratigraphy of the stream bed and separating out localised effects (such as weirs) were highlighted. The trials also highlighted that interpretation of the temperature data can be ambiguous when viewed in isolation. Results indicated that time-series measurements of sediment and stream temperatures can be a useful screening tool for identifying gaining and losing reaches and for identifying temporal variations in seepage flux. It is suggested that temperature loggers can be readily and cheaply incorporated into existing hydrographic networks to provide a greater understanding of stream-aquifer connectivity. It is also recommended that existing routine temperature logging (such as with pressure transducers) be upgraded to sufficient accuracy for seepage studies. Temperature monitoring would be particularly useful in estimating seepage from Australian ephemeral streams.

A long-term study at four sites on two streams in mediterranean-climate California (annual sampling over 20 yr) allowed us to quantify the influence of a 5-yr prolonged drought on stream invertebrate and fish communities. Invertebrate community composition did not show recovery following drought. The primary environmental factors influencing community composition, identified through principle components and multiple correspondence analyses were precipitation and flow permanence. Invertebrate taxon richness and abundance exhibited few responses (some site specific) and recovered quickly. Native fish abundance was lowest during the drought period and highest during the wet years that occurred at the end of the study period. Importantly, the prolonged drought facilitated the establishment and success of the invasive green sunfish (Centrarchidae: Lepomis cyanellus) that was then resilient to subsequent large flow events. There was high spatial synchrony in the temporal changes among all four sites, and three distinct periods were identified: early drought, late drought, and post-drought years. However, we still found differences among sites along the flow permanence gradient from temporary to perennial in the response to drought of both invertebrate and fish assemblages likely as a result of changes in substrate, vegetation, and other habitat characteristics. The observed lack of resilience and negative impacts to biodiversity due to prolonged drought associated with long-term habitat changes is important because hydroclimatic extremes are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude with global climate change.",ECOGRAPHY,32,5,,778,788,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05612.x,,,,,,0906-7590; 1600-0587,,WOS:000270311000008

The jarabugo as well as the blenny showed a very restricted distribution, mainly jarabugo (only present in 14.3 % of the sites) which in comparison with previous studies suffered a strong reduction on its distribution area (86%). This species preferred small streams (generally less than 10 m channel width) and with submerged aquatic vegetation, while the blenny appeared mostly in large downstream stretches (> 10 m channel width), a higher water flow, and water availability (permanent water flow). Based on a randomisation test (Monte Carlo simulation), blenny distribution was random with respect to exotic species. However, the jarabugo and the centrarchidae (Lepomis gibbosus and Micropterus salmoides) never coexisted in the same locations, despite a high probability of co-occurrence expected by chance (Monte Carlo simulation P = 0.965).

In the northeastern United States, these systems, whether ephemeral (""vernal"") pools or ephemeral or intermittent headwater streams are abundant and provide unique habitats critical to the maintenance of forest biodiversity. Since the hydrology of these waterbodies is strongly affected by weather patterns (in the short-term) or climate (long-term), they are especially sensitive to climate change. In this essay, I review the literature on relationships between climate and hydrology of EFS and on relationships between hydrology and ecology of these systems. I then conclude with my assessment of potential impacts of GCC on the hydrology of EFS and implications for their ecology. The focus of this essay will be on EFS of the forests of the northeastern United States, but will include literature from other regions as they relate to the general relationships between GCC and EFS.",CLIMATIC CHANGE,95,41732,,469,483,,10.1007/s10584-008-9531-9,,,,,,0165-0009; 1573-1480,,WOS:000268255300013

The ESO model is the well-known and widely used stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) technique. The PSO models comprise a variant of the standard operating policy (SOP), reservoir zoning, and a two-dimensional hedging rule. The models are applied to the operation of a single reservoir damming an intermittent river in northeastern Brazil. The standard operating policy is also included in the comparison and operational results provided by deterministic optimization based on perfect forecasts are used as a benchmark. In general, the ISO and PSO models performed better than SDP and the SOP. In addition, the proposed ISO-based surface modeling procedure and the PSO-based two-dimensional hedging rule showed superior overall performance as compared with the neuro-fuzzy approach.

Stickleback populations were strictly annual, with reproduction events involving exclusively 1+ fish. Somatic growth was concentrated in two periods, one in spring and early summer, and another in autumn and winter. During summer there was a clear stop in the somatic growth, coupled with low values of somatic condition. This growth pattern contrasts both with that of other Mediterranean stream fish species and that of stickleback in other European locations. Stickleback populations occupied mainly intermediate locations along fluvial gradients. The presence of abundant aquatic vegetation was identified as one of the main factors related with both stickleback presence and the abundance of its populations, while the latter was also negatively related with that of invasive fish and crayfish species.

During the past century, human activities have altered or eliminated many intermittent stream and floodplain habitats in the valley. As a result, the remaining intermittent streams and ditches, referred to as watercourses, may still provide habitat that is critical for native fish. Our objectives were to determine (1) fish presence, (2) the spatial gradients of fish distribution (including species identity, native versus nonnative status, and numbers), (3) fish use of the intermittent streams as spawning and nursery habitats, and (4) the main factors that influence the numbers of fish and fish species. In the winter and spring of 2002 - 2003, we examined the distributions of fish species in five subbasins within the Willamette River valley. The sampling sites were in intermittent watercourses that drained grass seed producing fields. We collected water samples and sampled fish from December to May with minnow traps and an electrofishing unit and collected data on the standard fish habitat variables at all sites in spring. Thirteen fish species were found and only three of them were exotic. The presence of recently hatched and juvenile fish shows that intermittent watercourses offer conditions suitable for spawning and juvenile rearing. The two watershed-scale variables with the most influence on fish species richness were the percentage of the watershed covered by forest and the distance to perennial water, the first of which had a direct relationship to species diversity and the second an inverse relationship. In turn, fish abundance had a negative, albeit modest, relationship with the distance to perennial water. Among local-scale variables, water velocity and conductivity were inversely related to species richness and fish numbers. Our results highlight the relevance of intermittent agricultural watercourses for native fish species in the Willamette River valley and call for the promotion of agricultural conservation practices that benefit farmers while maintaining aquatic biodiversity in floodplain habitats.",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,138,6,,1302,1313,,10.1577/T08-150.1,,,,,,0002-8487,,WOS:000277124500009

We used stable isotope ratios ((13)C/(12)C, and (15)N/(14)N) to characterize the trophic base of two streams in the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas, U. S. A. We predicted that autochthonous resources would be more important during the spring and summer and allochthonous resources would be more important in the winter due to increased detritus inputs from the riparian zone during autumn leaf drop. We predicted that stream communities would demonstrate increased reliance on autochthonous resources at sites with larger watersheds and greater canopy openness. The study was conducted at three low-order sites in the Mulberry River Drainage (watershed area range: 81-232 km(2)) seasonally in 2006 and 2007. We used circular statistics to examine community-wide shifts in isotope space among fish and invertebrate consumers in relation to basal resources, including detritus and periphyton. Mixing models were used to quantify the relative contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous energy sources to individual invertebrate consumers. Significant isotopic shifts occurred but results varied by season and site indicating substantial variation in the trophic base of stream food webs. In terms of temporal variation, consumers shifted toward periphyton in the summer during periods of low discharge, but results varied during the interval between summer and winter.

During 2005 to 2007, we monitored summer flows and crayfish densities in 10 riffles in a Missouri (US) Ozark stream to document stream drying and crayfish persistence. Stream drying variables were riffle wetted area (m(2)) and current velocity (m/s). Crayfish density estimates were obtained with a quadrat sampler. We sampled monthly (May-August 2006) to examine crayfish response to decreased flows, and excavated dry quadrat samples (to 30 cm depth) after surface flows ceased. Over 2 periods during summer 2007, we used baited traps in the stream and a downstream reservoir where the stream terminates to examine whether crayfish migrated from the stream to permanent water in response to drying. Riffles dried significantly by July, few had surface water present by August, and all were rewetted by the following June. Annual June densities of O. williamsi remained stable throughout the study, whereas densities of O. m. meeki were lower in 2007 than 2005.

Assessment,2009,"Estrany, Joan; Garcia, Celso; Batalla, Ramon J.","Groundwater control on the suspended sediment load in the Na Borges River, Mallorca, Spain","Groundwater dominance has important effects on the hydrological and geomorphological characteristics of river systems. Low suspended sediment concentrations and high water clarity are expected because significant inputs of sediment-free spring water dilute the suspended sediment generated by storms. However, in many Mediterranean rivers, groundwater dominance is characterised by seasonal alternations of influent and effluent discharge involving significant variability on the sediment transport regimes. Such areas are often subject to soil and water conservation practices over the centuries that have reduced the sediment contribution from agricultural fields and favour subsurface flow to rivers. Moreover, urbanisation during the twentieth century has changed the catchment hydrology and altered basic river processes due to its 'flashy' regime. In this context, we monitored suspended sediment fluxes during a two-year period in the Na Borges River, a lowland agricultural catchment (319 km(2)) on the island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was lower when the base flow index (i.e., relative proportion of baseflow compared to stormflow, BFI) was higher. Therefore, strong seasonal contrasts explain the high SSC coefficient of variation, which is clearly related to dilution effects associated with different groundwater and surface water seasonal interactions. A lack of correlation in the Q-SSC rating curves shows that factors other than discharge control sediment transport. As a result, at the event scale, multiple regressions illustrate that groundwater and surface water interactions are involved in the sedimentary response of flood events. In the winter, the stability of baseflow driven by groundwater contributions and agricultural and urban spills causes hydraulic variables (i.e., maximum discharge) to exert the most important control on events, whereas in the summer, it is necessary to accumulate important volumes of rainfall, creating a minimum of wet conditions in the catchment to activate hydrological pathways and deliver sediment to the drainage network. The BFI is also related to sediment delivery processes, as the loads are higher with lower BFI, corroborating the fact that most sediment movement is caused by stormflow and its related factors. Overall, suspended sediment yields were very low (i.e., <1 t km(-2) yr(-1)) at all measuring sites. Such values are the consequence of the limited sediment delivery attributable to soil conservation practices, low surface runoff coefficients and specific geomorphic features of groundwater-dominated rivers, such as low drainage density, low gradient, steep valley walls and flat valley floors.

Carbamazepine and clarithromycin were the most frequently detected compounds in water. Ctarithromycin was determined at high mu g/L Levels in river water during the winter season due to the lack of dilution by background water while clarithromycin and azithromycin were ubiquitous in sediment. These contamination levels were at one order of magnitude higher than those reported in large European rivers. It could be shown that clarithromycin can be regarded as a priority antibiotic to be monitored in river waters mainly because this chemical showed high persistence in water and underwent stow dissipation processes in sediment.

"Fish, Biogeochemistry, ",2009,"Fellows, Christine S.; Bunn, Stuart E.; Sheldon, Fran; Beard, Nerida J.",Benthic metabolism in two turbid dryland rivers,"1. Australian dryland rivers have among the most variable discharge of any rivers worldwide and are characterized by extended periods of no flow during which aquatic habitat contracts into isolated waterholes. Despite naturally high turbidity, benthic primary production is known to be the main source of carbon to waterhole food webs. The objective of this study was to quantify rates of benthic metabolism and identify factors influencing these rates in two Australian dryland rivers, the Cooper Creek and the Warrego River.2. Both rivers have similar variable hydrology and high levels of turbidity (photic depths < 0.4 m), but fish abundance in Cooper Creek is 10 times than that of the Warrego River. Therefore, an additional aim of the study was to determine if fish abundances reflected underlying differences in benthic primary production.3. Benthic gross primary production (GPP), benthic respiration, nutrient concentrations and light penetration were measured immediately after flow had ceased ('post-flow') and after at least 2 months of zero flow ('no-flow') in 15 waterholes from each river. A subset of four waterholes from each river was sampled on two additional occasions to determine if patterns were consistent over time.4. Cooper Creek generally had higher rates of GPP and a more autotrophic benthic zone than the Warrego River. As a result, the expected positive relationship between fish abundance and GPP was generally observed at a broad catchment scale.4. Light was the major control in benthic GPP in both rivers, as nutrient concentrations were high on all sampling occasions. However, for similar values of photic depth, GPP was greater in Cooper Creek than in the Warrego River. This suggests that more frequent disturbance of the littoral zone may inhibit biofilm development in waterholes of the Warrego River.5. Although flow variability in dryland rivers is extreme compared with other rivers worldwide, cycles of expansion and contraction of aquatic habitat in these two rivers were associated with a shift in the dominance of regional scale (subcatchments contributing to river flow) versus local scale (waterhole morphology) influences on ecosystem functioning, similar to floodplain rivers in tropical and temperate regions.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,54,2,,236,253,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02104.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000262470300002

We examined colonization of leaves by microbes (bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) and fauna in Fuirosos, an intermittent forested Mediterranean stream. Black poplar (Populus nigra) and plane (Platanus acerifolia) leaf packs were placed in the stream for 4 mo. We measured the biomasses and calculated the densities of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, meiofauna, and macroinvertebrates to determine their dynamics and potential interactions throughout the colonization process. Colonization was strongly correlated with hydrological variability (defined mainly by water temperature and discharge). The 1(st) week of colonization was characterized by hydrological stability and warm water temperatures, and allocation of C from microbial to invertebrate compartments on the leaf packs was rapid. Clumps of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) were retained by the leaf packs, and enhanced rapid colonization by microfauna and meiofaunal collector-gatherers (ostracods and copepods). After 2 wk, an autumnal flood caused a 20-fold increase in water flow. Higher discharge and lower water temperature caused FPOM-related fauna to drift away from the packs and modified the subsequent colonization sequence. Fungi showed the highest biomass, with similar values to those recorded at the beginning of the experiment. After 70 d of postflood colonization, fungi decreased to nearly 40% of the total C in the leaf packs, whereas invertebrates became more abundant and accounted for 60% of the C. Natural flood occurrence in Mediterranean streams could be a key factor in the colonization and processing of organic matter.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,28,1,,34,43,,10.1899/07-131.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000263481300004

Autumn-olive fixes nitrogen (N) via a symbiotic relationship with the actinomycete Frankia. At the plot scale, the presence of autumn-olive has been related to elevated soil water nitrate-N (NO(3)(-)-N) concentrations. This study examined the relationship between autumn-olive cover in a watershed and stream water quality. Stream water nitrate-N (NO(3)(-)-N) and ammonium-N (NH(4)(+)-N) concentrations were measured in 12 first order ephemeral streams draining watersheds with mixed forest cover and a range of 0-35% autumn-olive cover. Percent autumn-olive cover was positively correlated with mean stream NO(3)(-)-N concentrations, but was not correlated with mean stream NH(4)(+)-N concentrations. While other studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between native N-fixers and stream NO(3)(-)-N, this is the first study to document a relationship for an invasive, exotic N-fixing species.

In this paper aerial orthophotographs were used for (i) analysing the evolution of a valley bottom gully and its relation with land use and vegetation cover, (ii) exploring the role of land use and vegetation cover on the coefficients of the equation S = aA(-b) (where S is slope at the headcut and A is drainage area), which is based on the topographical threshold concept and is commonly used to predict gully initiation. The study was carried out in a small catchment (99.5 ha) located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. Gullies and headcuts were mapped together with land use and vegetation cover using aerial photographs for the years 1945, 1956, 1989, 1998, 2002 and 2006, which had to be digitized and orthorectified in advance. The results showed an increase of the area affected by gullying front 695 m(2) in 1945-1009 m(2) in 2006, reaching a maximum of 1560 m(2) in 1956. Gullying was closely related with land use, especially with the amount of cultivated areas within the catchment and also with grazing intensity. No clear relationship was found between the evolution of the gullied area and rainfall amounts. Finally, the values of the exponent b obtained for different headcuts and different dates (close to 0.4) were similar to those proposed by other authors for gully erosion caused by Hortonian overland flow in semiarid environments.

Biogeochemistry,2009,"Gomez, Rosa; Garcia, Victoria; Vidal-Abarca, Rosario; Suarez, Luisa",Effect of intermittency on N spatial variability in an and Mediterranean stream,"We compared spatial patterns of N (NO(3)(-)-N and NH(4)(+)-N) and Cl(-) variability in 2 reaches with different hydrological regimes (permanent vs intermittent) of a typical Mediterranean semiarid stream under different hydrological conditions (baseflow, high flow, and drought). We hypothesized that stream-flow intermittency would affect N spatial variability. We expected higher spatial variability of solute concentrations in intermittent reaches than in permanent reaches because local environmental conditions (advection, water residence time, temperature, biotic properties, sediment-water interactions, or environment redox condition) change through space as flow discharge does. We expected spatial heterogeneity of solute concentrations to change more through seasons, as do stream hydrological conditions (high flood periods and drought), in the intermittent than in the permanent reach. We also expected seasonal variability to be higher in the intermittent than in the permanent reach. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) to measure the spatial and seasonal variability of solute concentration. We used a null model to test whether the differences in CVs among reaches were statistically significant. NH(4)(+)-N was the most spatially variable form of N in the intermittent reach. NO(3)(-)-N and Cl(-) were seasonally more variable in the intermittent reach than in the permanent one. We propose that NO(3)(-)-N and Cl(-) temporal variations are generated mainly by seasonal changes in advection, as shown by the synchrony between solute concentrations and rainfall. However, we propose that NH(4)(+)-N seasonal variation is generated mainly by the variation of biotic (uptake and dissimilatory reduction) and abiotic drivers (geochemical processes, such as chemical sorption-desorption) over time as hydrological conditions change. We also analyzed the effect of hydrological conditions on N spatial variability. We predicted that N spatial variability would decrease after rainfall and would increase during drought periods, especially in the intermittent reach. The results obtained in the intermittent reach fulfilled this prediction. However, the increase in runoff after the spring and autumn rainfall in the permanent reach increased the spatial variability in both N forms and Cl(-). For our scale of comparison (5-8 km, 13 mo), NO(3)(-)-N and Cl(-) were more variable spatially than seasonally in the permanent reach, whereas they were more variable seasonally than spatially in the intermittent reach. NH(4)(+)-N concentrations in both reaches were more variable seasonally than spatially.

Biogeochemistry,2009,"Gutierrez-Canovas, Cayetano; Velasco, Josefa; Millan, Andres",Effects of dilution stress on the functioning of a saline Mediterranean stream,"The effects of seasonality and dilution stress on the functioning of Rambla Salada, a hypersaline Mediterranean stream in SE Spain, were evaluated. The stream is subject to diffuse freshwater inputs from the drainage of intensively irrigated agriculture in the catchment and periodic losses of water through an irrigation channel. Metabolic rates and the biomass of primary producers and consumers were estimated over a 2-year period. During the first year several dilution events occurred, while during the second year the salinity recovery reached predisturbance levels. Functional indicators were compared in the disturbance and recovery salinity periods. Primary production and respiration rates in the Rambla Salada ranged between 0.07-21.05 and 0.19-17.39 g O(2) m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The mean values for these variables were 7.35 and 5.48 g O(2) m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Mean net daily metabolism rate was 1.87 +/- A 0.52 g O(2) m(-2) day(-1) and mean production/respiration ratio was 2.48 +/- A 1.1, reflecting autotrophic metabolism. The metabolic rates showed the typical seasonal pattern of Mediterranean open canopy streams. Therefore, gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) registered maximum values in summer, intermediate values in spring and autumn and minimum values in winter. The metabolic rates and biomass of consumers were greater in the disturbance period than in the recovery period. However, they did not show significant differences between periods due to their important dependence on seasonal cycle. Seasonality accounted for much of the temporal variability in GPP and ER (76% and 83% in the multiregression models, respectively). Light availability seems to be the most important factor for GPP and ER in the Rambla Salada. Autotrophic biomass responded more to variations in discharge and conductivity than to seasonal variations. In fact, it was severely affected by freshwater inputs after which the epipelic biomass decreased significantly and Cladophora glomerata proliferated rapidly. Epipelic algal biomass was the most sensitive parameter to dilution disturbance.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,619,,,119,132,,10.1007/s10750-008-9604-9,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000261751000009

We investigated the vegetation in this area to measure the influence of groundwater table depth on plant diversity and species ecological niche. The results indicated that plant diversity was highest at the 2 to 4 m groundwater table depth, followed by that at 4 to 6 m, and then that at 0 to 2 m. When the groundwater depth dropped to below 6 m, species diversity decreased dramatically, and the slope of Hill's index tended to level off. The ecological niche of the major species in this area initially expanded as the groundwater level dropped. The widest niche appeared at the 4 to 6 m groundwater table depth and gradually narrowed with deepening groundwater. Ecological niche analysis also revealed that the 4 to 6 m groundwater table depth was associated with the lowest degree of niche overlap and the richest variety of species. Our findings indicate that in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, the groundwater table depth must be a minimum of 6 m for vegetation restoration; it should be maintained at 2 to 4 m in the vicinity of the water path, and at 4 to 6 m for the rest of this arid area.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,152,41730,,167,177,,10.1007/s10661-008-0305-7,,,,,,0167-6369,,WOS:000264620900015

However, each system appears to comprise similar functional groupings despite phylogenetic differences. I hypothesized that assemblages within a river would be more similar to one another, regardless of season, than assemblages from other localities based on taxonomic organization; however, assemblages from different rivers but within the same season would be more similar to one another based on functional organization. I assessed functional and taxonomic organizations of fish assemblages from three tributaries of the Colorado River in Texas (Pedernales River, San Saba River, and South Llano River) across all four seasons. Direct ordination methods resulted in assemblages from the same river, regardless of season, clustering together. More specifically, the functional and taxonomic organizations of assemblages from the South Llano River, regardless of season, were noticeably different than that from both the Pedernales River and the San Saba River, at least with respect to the first ordination axis.

Assessment,2009,"Hughes, D. A.",SIMULATING THE HYDROLOGY AND TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS) OF AN EPHEMERAL RIVER IN SOUTH AFRICA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WATER REQUIREMENT DETERMINATIONS,"Existing hydrological approaches to support the determination of environmental water requirements (EWRs) were largely developed for perennial rivers and may not be applicable to ephemeral rivers, where the quantity and quality dynamics of pool storage and frequency of connection can be more important than flow rates. The Current understanding of semi-arid hydrological processes and how best to apply hydrological models in ephemeral systems is less well developed than for more humid regions. The paper reports on the application of monthly and daily time-step rainfall-runoff models to simulating the hydrology (including pool storage) of the Seekoei River basin, a tributary of the Orange River in the Northern Province, South Africa. The hydrological response of the basin is spatially variable, a relatively small part of the basin generating a large proportion of the total stream flow. The outputs from the hydrological models have been used as inputs to a simple water quality mass balance model designed to simulate the total dissolved solids (TDS) of both flow and pool storage. The results from both the water quantity and quality models are encouraging when compared with the available observed data. While there are no data to confirm the simulation results at sub-basin scales, they do appear to be conceptually acceptable. The conclusion is that the results are adequate to support ecological studies in the determination of EWRs.

Reliable lotic ecological monitoring requires knowledge of river typology, environmental factors, the effect of stressors known here as 'pressures' and appropriate indicators of anthropogenically induced change. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, bird and macrophyte communities along an intermittent Mediterranean river and analysed community structure (relative abundance) and function (metrics) relative to environmental and pressure gradients in order to identify suitable indicator group(s) for future monitoring and mitigation programmes.2. Principal components analysis revealed that scale-dependent longitudinal differences in valley form separated narrower higher lying sites and tributaries with good quality habitats from more open degraded sites lower down the river continuum on a small floodplain and large scale pressures describing changes in land use related to agriculture with associated physical bankside and channel impacts.3. Forward selection of variables in redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that reach scale environmental variables were selected more frequently than pressure variables for each organism group. Altitude and pH were highly redundant within and between groups, indicating essentially longitudinal structural and functional distribution patterns. Redundancy was far lower between selected pressure variables, but single or no pressure variables were retained for some organism groups indicating poor association of functional data, in particular, with the identified pressures. All RDA results indicated a longitudinal pH gradient, highlighting the combined effect of multiple environmental and pressure based mechanisms on organism groups.4. Large, mobile organisms such as fish and birds provided a reliable link between organism structure and function, environmental factors and physical disturbance of the channel, bankside and wider river corridor. Benthic macroinvertebrate and macrophyte structural data revealed distribution patterns in relation to water velocity, a key parameter for developing appropriate compensation measures.5.

This situation brings forth the physical transformation of the channels, thus modifying many characteristics implicated in the biotic and abiotic processes involved in nitrogen retention. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the channel invasion by Phragmites australis negatively affects nitrogen retention. Therefore. we compared the retention rates (%R) of NO(3)(-) - N and NH(4)(+) - N in different subreaches of the same temporal stream: a unvegetated subreach (238 m(2)). and two vegetated subreaches that differed in surface areas (480 m(2) and 910 m(2)). The results showed that the retention efficiency (%R) for both solutes were higher in the unvegetated subreach. Although there are no conclusive results. it seems that the differences were more important outside the vegetated period of the helophytes. while during the spring-summer period an increase of the retention rates in the vegetated subreaches could occur. In the same Wily, the capacity of the subreaches for N-nitrate retention, showed a clear dependency of the nitrogen inputs, decreasing as the nitrogen load increases. However, the unvegetated subreach showed a greater load capacity than the vegetated subreach with larger Surface. and this one. greater than the vegetated subreach with the smaller surface. This study reveals that channel invasion by Phragmites australis, a generalized phenomenon in many parts of the world, not only can bring about changes in the structure of the vegetation and the fauna in the streams, but can also affect its function, and especially a key process involved in Water quality.

According to the flood pulse concept, the marsh floodplains would have stored large amounts of nutrients and carbon during dry antecedent conditions, which would be released into the overlaying flood water. Field studies were conducted in mid-December 2005 at two sites, one on open floodplain woodland with a sparse canopy of River Red Gum and ground cover dominated by saltbushes and the other on open floodplain with black roly-poly. At each site, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton were monitored daily for a 6-day period from the overlaying water of a floodplain inundated by the environmental water release. Those in mesocosms deployed in situ, containing marsh floodplain sediments that had been inundated artificially, were also monitored. The mesocosm results from both the sites showed that release of nitrogen was rapid, attaining mean concentrations of total nitrogen of 3.7-14.8 mg l(-1), followed by more gradual increases in total phosphorus (mean concentrations 0.6-0.8 mg l(-1)) and DOC (26.1-50.2 mg l(-1)) within the 6-day experiment; planktonic microbial communities developed concomitantly with the increasing concentrations of nutrients and DOC, attaining mean densities of (6.0-6.9) x 10(6) cells ml(-1) of planktonic bacteria and (80.7-81.4) x 10(3) cells ml(-1) of phytoplankton; and for each site the overall measured condition of the mesocosm tended to approach that of the Marshes, over the course of the 6-day experiment. The present study (both observational and experimental) demonstrates that the floodplain sediments in the Marshes, which have been exposed to dry antecedent conditions, release nutrients and carbon to the overlaying flood water following inundation. These resources are thought to have been stored during the dry antecedent phase in accord with the flood pulse concept. Based on the mesocosm experiment, the released nutrients and carbon are in turn most likely to be used by microbial components, such as bacteria and algae, which develop within days of inundation of the floodplain sediments.

Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna.2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta.3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation.4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages.5.

To better understand the function of these riparian forest corridors, we characterized the tree density and composition, forest floor mass, and downed woody debris volume within SMZs located in undisturbed, mature, upper mid-slope shortleaf pine stands and then compared these attributes to those in upland portions of these stands. In addition to evaluate the impact of upland forest harvesting on these riparian corridors, we compared the amounts and distribution of forest floor, downed woody debris (DWD), snags, and windthrows in SMZs within shortleaf pine stands that had been clearcut, had a shelterwood harvest, and had no recent management activity (uncut stands). Total tree and hardwood basal area was significantly higher (4.4 and 4.2 m(2) ha(-1)) while forest floor mass was significantly lower (0.5 kg m(-2)) in the SMZs than in the upland portion of the undisturbed stands. Five years following the reproduction cuttings tree basal area, DWD volume, and forest floor mass within SMZs did not significantly differ among stands that had or had not been harvested. Snag density was significantly lower within SMZs that occurred in clearcut stands compared to those in the uncut or shelterwood stands. Harvesting activities that retain few or no residual trees appear to increase the degradation of snags. This study provided evidence that clearcutting may also increase the risk of windthrow in SMZs as well. There was little difference in the distribution of forest floor within SMZs regardless of whether the stand was harvested or the type of harvesting that occurred in the stand. However, DWD amounts were higher near the SMZs edge than in the interior of the SMZs with the greatest differences in distributions in stands that were clearcut. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Presented here is a study on the life history of a mayfly species, Serratella ignita, in two Mediterranean streams, one permanent and one temporary. The research focuses on life history parameters such as life cycle, nymphal growth pattern, feeding type, biomass and secondary production. The life cycle was univoltine, showing a fast seasonal nymphal growth during four months in the permanent stream and five months in the temporary stream, with a long egg stage with diapause. The cumulated day-degrees during nymphal growth were similar between streams. Both populations behaved mainly as gatherer-collectors, but the population from the temporary stream also played an important role as a scraper. Animal matter was also consumed by nymphs from both populations. Gut content analysis showed that both S. ignita populations were opportunist/generalists, where changes in diet were correlated with size. Biomass and secondary production were notably higher in the permanent stream, but they were also high in the temporary stream. These data show that S. ignita had a high fitness in both streams. Our results support the idea that species such as this one may cope with future global climate change by maintaining, or even increasing, their populations at the expense of more stenoecic species.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,71,2,,179,188,,10.1007/s00027-009-9211-5,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000267329600009

Seasonal summer drying is extensive in these systems and might alter interactions between these consumers and stream benthic communities. Electrical exclusion of consumers was used to examine changes in the effects of fish and crayfish on algal abundance, sediment deposition, sediment organic matter content (as ash-free dry mass [AFDM]) and invertebrate density on tiles during stream drying. Replicate paired exclusion/exposed treatments were placed in 8 pools for two 30-d periods in June and August 2006 during an extended period of stream drying. Consumer exclusion increased algal chlorophyll a 1.5X, sediment organic matter content 2.3X, sediment dry mass 3.4X, and chironomid density 21 X relative to levels on exposed tiles. Exclusion effects were greater in August than in June, but effects were not evident in all pools. In June, the strength of consumer effects on chlorophyll a was positively related to % canopy cover, whereas effects on dry mass were positively related to crayfish density, fish predator presence, and % canopy cover but negatively related to depth. In August, the strength of consumer effects on chlorophyll a was positively related to fish predator presence and effects on AFDM were positively related to stoneroller density. These results demonstrate the importance of environmental context when determining how fish and crayfish influence stream functioning and suggest that mechanisms that generate heterogeneity in streams deserve greater attention, especially because disturbances, such as stream drying, are predicted to intensify with climate change.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,28,2,,371,382,,10.1899/08-149.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000266645700010

During this period, an epizootic of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was detected for the first time in a Mediterranean stream, with 21% prevalence in a Population of redtail barbs Barbus haasi. Environmental features and the fish population in this stream were compared during 2007-2009. Fish density and the average fish size were reduced significantly after the outbreak of I. multifiliis in this population. During 2008, parasitized fish were significantly larger than nonparasitized fish. In addition, a significant, positive correlation was found between parasite load and fish size. The origin of I. multifiliis is unknown, but an introduced species detected in April 2007 may have carried it. The combination of stress to the redtail barbs due to suboptimal conditions and favorable environmental conditions for parasite multiplication (e.g., Suitable water temperature and low water flow) could have enhanced fish susceptibility to the parasite in April 2008.

One of the main objectives of the second phase of the project (2002-2005) was to develop a predictive system for the Spanish Mediterranean aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. A combined-season (spring, summer, and autumn) predictive model was developed by using the latest improvements on the selection of best predictor variables. Overall model performance measures were used to select the best discriminant function (DF) models, and also to evaluate their biases and precision. The final predictive model was based on the best five DF models. Each one of these models involved eight environmental variables. Final observed (O), expected (E), and O/E values for the number of macroinvertebrate families (NFAM) and two biotic indices (IBMWP and IASPT) were calculated by averaging their values, previously weighted by the quality of each DF model. Regression analyses among the final O and E values for the calibration dataset showed a high proximity to the ideal theoretical model, where the final E values explained 73-84% of the variation present in the macroinvertebrate communities of the Spanish Mediterranean watercourses. The ANOVA performed among the reference (calibration and validation) and test datasets showed clear differences for the O/E values.

Intermittent stream landscapes encompass a mosaic of soils of different textures and composition, and may support intense N transformation after rainfall. We modelled N mineralization potential by measuring accumulation of inorganic N (KCl extractable NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+)) in response to sustained flooding in soils from a small intermittent stream in semi-arid, north-west Australia. To test the relative importance of landscape position compared to flood pulse size, we incubated soils and sediments from six landscape positions, including three riparian vegetation types, rewetted to four different water potentials. Selected water potentials represented a light rain, heavy rain, single flood and successive flood event for the study site. The total amount of N mineralized was significantly affected by landscape position but not by saturation level. Riparian soils produced the greatest mineralization flush over 70% of the total amount of N mineralized accumulated within 48 h of rewetting - however there was no difference among riparian vegetation types in N mineralization potential. N mineralized was a half to two-thirds lower in channel, floodplain and bank soils in comparison with riparian soils. We conclude that in systems subject to prolonged drought, N mineralization is predominantly determined by soil characteristics rather than the size of the rewetting pulse. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Intermittent streams and their associated riparian communities are obvious 'hot spots' for biogeochemical processes in and landscapes where water and often C are limiting. Stream landscapes are characterized by highly heterogeneous soils that may respond variably to rewetting. We used a laboratory incubation to quantify how N and C mineralisation in rewetted soils and sediments from an intermittent stream in the semi-arid Pilbara region of north-west Australia varied with saturation level and substrate addition (as ground Eucalyptus litter). Full (100%) saturation was defined as the maximum gravimetric moisture content (%) achieved in free-draining soils and sediments after rewetting, with 50% saturation defined as half this value. We estimated rates and amounts of N mineralised from changes in inorganic N and microbial respiration as CO(2) efflux throughout the incubation. In soils and sediments subject to 50% saturation, >90% of N mineralised accumulated within the first 7 d of incubation, compared to only 48% when soils were fully saturated (100% saturation). Mineralisation rates and microbial respiration were similar in riparian and floodplain soils, and channel sediments. N mineralisation rates in litter-amended soils and sediments (0.73 mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) were only one-third that of unamended samples (3.04 mg N kg(-1) d(-1)), while cumulative microbial respiration was doubled in litteramended soils, suggesting N was more rapidly immobilized. Landscape position was less important in controlling microbial activity than soil saturation when water-filled pore space (% WFPS) was greater than 40%. Our results suggest that large pulses of water availability resulting in full soil saturation cause a slower release of mineralisation products, compared to small pulse events that stimulate a rapid cycle of C and N mineralisation-immobilization.

On the other hand, freshwater availability for aquatic ecosystems is often reduced due to competition with human uses, potentially leading to impacts on ecosystem quality. This paper summarises how this specific resource use can be dealt with in life cycle analysis (LCA).The main quantifiable impact pathways linking freshwater use to the available supply are identified, leading to definition of the flows requiring quantification in the life cycle inventory (LCI).The LCI needs to distinguish between and quantify evaporative and non-evaporative uses of 'blue' and 'green' water, along with land use changes leading to changes in the availability of freshwater. Suitable indicators are suggested for the two main impact pathways [namely freshwater ecosystem impact (FEI) and freshwater depletion (FD)], and operational characterisation factors are provided for a range of countries and situations. For FEI, indicators relating current freshwater use to the available freshwater resources (with and without specific consideration of water ecosystem requirements) are suggested. For FD, the parameters required for evaluation of the commonly used abiotic depletion potentials are explored.An important value judgement when dealing with water use impacts is the omission or consideration of non-evaporative uses of water as impacting ecosystems. We suggest considering only evaporative uses as a default procedure, although more precautionary approaches (e.g. an 'Egalitarian' approach) may also include non-evaporative uses. Variation in seasonal river flows is not captured in the approach suggested for FEI, even though abstractions during droughts may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems; this has been considered beyond the scope of LCA.The approach suggested here improves the representation of impacts associated with freshwater use in LCA. The information required by the approach is generally available to LCA practitionersThe widespread use of the approach suggested here will require some development (and consensus) by LCI database developers. Linking the suggested midpoint indicators for FEI to a damage approach will require further analysis of the relationship between FEI indicators and ecosystem health.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT,14,1,,28,42,,10.1007/s11367-008-0030-z,,,,,,0948-3349; 1614-7502,,WOS:000261973900004

We applied methodologies for rainfall-runoff and groundwater recharge computations that heavily rely on observations extracted from a wide-range of global remote sensing data sets (TRMM, SSM/l, Landsat TM, AVHRR, AMSR-E, and ASTER) using the arid Sinai Peninsula (SP; area: 61,000 km(2)) and the Eastern Desert (ED; area: 220,000 km(2)) of Egypt as our test sites. A two-fold exercise was conducted. Spatiotemporal remote sensing data (TRMM, AVHRR and AMSR-E) were extracted from global data sets over the test sites using RESDEM, the Remote Sensing Data Extraction Model, and were then used to identify and to verify precipitation events throughout the past 10 years (1998-2007). This was accomplished by using an automated cloud detection technique to identify clouds and to monitor their propagation prior to and throughout the identified precipitation events, and by examining changes in soil moisture (extracted from AMSR-E data) following the identification of clouds. For the investigated period, 246 of 327 events were verified in the SP, and 179 of 304 in the ED. A catchment-based, continuous, semi-distributed hydrologic model (Soil Water and Assessment Tool model; SWAT) was calibrated against observed runoff values from Wadi Girafi Watershed (area: 3350 km(2)) and then used to provide a continuous simulation (1998-2007) of the overland flow, channel flow, transmission losses, evaporation on bare soils and evapo-transpiration, and groundwater recharge for the major (area: 2014-22,030 km(2)) watersheds in the SP (Watir, El-Arish, Dahab, and Awag) and the ED (Qena, Hammamat, Asyuti, Tarfa, El-Quffa, El-Batur, Kharit, Hodein, and Allaqi) covering 48% and 51% of the total areas of the SP and the ED, respectively. For the investigated watersheds in the SP, the average annual precipitation, average annual runoff, and average annual recharge through transmission losses were found to be: 2955 x 10(6)m(3), 508 x 10(6)m(3) (17.1% total precipitation (TP)), and 463 x 10(6)m(3) (15.7% TP), respectively, whereas in the ED these values are: 807 x 10(6)m(3), 77.8 x 10(6)m(3) (9.6% TP), and 171 x 10(6)m(3) (21.2% TP), respectively. Results demonstrate the enhanced opportunities for groundwater development in the SP (compared to the ED) and highlight the potential for similar applications in and areas elsewhere. The adopted remote sensing-based, regionalization approach is not a substitute for traditional methodologies that rely on extensive field datasets from rain gauge and stream flow networks, yet could provide first-order estimates for rainfall, runoff, and recharge over large sectors of the and world lacking adequate coverage with spatial and temporal precipitation and field data.

Quantitative estimations of these resources are limited by the scarcity of data from such regions. The floods of the Kuiseb River in the Namib Desert have been monitored for 46 years, providing a unique data set of flow hydrographs from one of the world's hyperarid regions. The study objectives were to: (1) subject the records to quality control; (2) model flood routing and transmission losses; and (3) study the relationships between flood characteristics, river characteristics and recharge into the aquifers. After rigorous quality-testing of the original gauge-station data, a flood-routing model based on kinematic flow with components accounting for channel-bed infiltration was constructed and applied to the data. A simplified module added to this routing model estimates aquifer recharge from the infiltrating flood water. Most of the model parameters were obtained from field surveys and GIS analyses. Two of the model parameters-Manning's roughness coefficient and the constant infiltration rate-were calibrated based on the high-quality measured flow data set, providing values of 0.025 and 8.5 mm/h, respectively. This infiltration rate is in agreement with that estimated from extensive direct TDR-based moisture measurements in the vadose zone under the Kuiseb River channel, and is low relative to those reported for other sites. The model was later verified with additional flood data and observed groundwater levels in boreholes. Sensitivity analysis showed the important role of large and medium floods in aquifer recharge. To generalize from the studied river to other streams with diverse conditions, we demonstrate that with increasing in infiltration rate, channel length or active channel width, the relative contribution of high-magnitude floods to recharge also increases, whereas medium and small floods contribute less, often not reaching the downstream parts of the and ephemeral river at all. For example, more than three-quarters of the floods reaching the downstream Kuiseb River (with an infiltration rate of 8.5 mm/h) would not have reached similar distances in rivers with all other properties similar but with infiltration rates of 50 mm/h. The recharge volume in the downstream segment in the case of higher infiltration is mainly contributed by floods with magnitude >= 93rd percentile, compared to floods in the 63rd percentile at an infiltration rate of 8.5 mm/h.

This will facilitate the comparative assessment of ecological status throughout the European Union. According to the WFD, biologic indices should respond consistently to human impacts, using multimetric approaches and water-quality classification boundaries adjusted to a common set of normative definitions. The European Commission has started an intercalibration exercise to review biologic indices and harmonize class boundaries. We used data from rivers in Spain to compare the IBMWP (Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party) index, which is commonly used by water authorities in Spain and by several research centers, with the Intercalibration Common Multimetric Index (ICM-Star), which was used as a standard in the intercalibration exercise. We also used data from Spanish rivers to compare the multimetric indices ICM-7 (based on quantitative data) and ICM-9 (based on qualitative data) with the IBMWP. ICM-7 and ICM-9 were proposed by the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group (Med-GIG). Additionally, we evaluated two new multimetric indices, developed specifically for macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting Mediterranean river systems. One of these is based on quantitative data (ICM-10), while the other is based on qualitative data (ICM-11a). The results show that the IBMWP index responds well to the stressor gradient present in our data, and correlates well with ICM-Star. Moreover, the IBMWP quality class boundaries were consistent with the intercalibration requirements of the WFD. However, multimetric indices showed a more linear relation with the stressor gradient in our data, and less variation in reference values. In addition, they may provide more statistical power for detecting potential environmental impacts. Multimetric indices produced similar results for quantitative and qualitative data. Thus, ICM-10 (also named IMMi-T) and ICM-11a (also named IMMi-L) indices could be used to meet European Commission requirements for assessing the water quality in Spanish Mediterranean rivers.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,628,1,,203,225,,10.1007/s10750-009-9757-1,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000266007900015

We studied the response of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities in 48 dry-season river pools in the Save-Runde river system (Lowveld, Zimbabwe). Patterns and ecological processes influencing invertebrate communities, taxon richness and macroinvertebrate functional richness were investigated with focus on the role of regional (connectivity) and local processes (habitat characteristics). Local factors accounted for 15% of the variability in the zooplankton community but only 3.4% for the macroinvertebrate community. Important factors affecting zooplankton densities in the pools were depth, vegetation cover and presence of fish (planktivorous and omnivorous). The presence of fish in pools can infer predation risk. Macroinvertebrate abundances were affected by the presence of fish only. Zooplankton densities increased in pools with fish while macroinvertebrate densities declined in the presence of fish. Macroinvertebrates could exert top-down pressure on zooplankton either by competition for resources or predation in pools. Regional factors significantly explained zooplankton but not macroinvertebrate community variability. Connectivity had no significant effect on local pool habitat characteristics. There were no significant differences in water quality variables between flowing river sites and the pools. Zooplankton and macroinvertebrate alpha- and gamma-diversity in dry-season pools was higher than in the flowing river. Species additions rather than species replacements by processes that include dispersal and possibly dormancy may explain increased zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxon diversity in pools. Functional feeding group (FFG) analysis showed that the proportion of macroinvertebrate predator taxa increased significantly in pools compared to the flowing river. Pools create a more suitable and diverse habitat for these widely dispersing taxa. The other FFG were comparable between the river and pools. The pools are strongly heterotrophic.

The combination of available habitats varies throughout the year as a result of water flow fluctuations (BONADA et al. 2007). Consequently, how effectively species is able to adapt to the drastic flow fluctuations during its life cycle can determine seasonal variation in benthic community composition (BECHE et al. 2006). These constraints act as ecological filters responsible for community structure (STATZNER et al. 2004), both in terms of taxonomic composition and functional characteristics. Evaluating functional characteristics by aggregating individuals into nontaxonomic groups of taxa as similar as possible in their biological and ecological traits is less dependent on seasonal variability (BECHE et al. 2006), making community response to abiotic conditions more informative (STEARNS 1992, RICHARDS et al. 1997, STATZNER et al. 1997, USSEGLIO-POLATERA et al. 2000) and permitting the comparison of communities on a larger biogeographical scale (DOLEDEC et al. 2006).

This study aimed to determine whether the magnitude of temporal and spatial variation is different for taxonomic composition and for trait profiles.

We applied biosolids at a rate of 1120 and 629 kg ha(-1) of total nitrogen and total P outside the SMZ on one side of each of the streams while maintaining the other side of the stream as control.

Along transects perpendicular to the treated streams, we collected overland flow samples, soil solution samples at 60 cm, and extracts from ion exchange membranes (IEMs) placed in the surface soil. We observed significantly elevated P concentrations adjacent to the scream in overland flow during one period on the treated side of the stream. We found significantly elevated nitrate concentrations outside the SMZ in the treated-side soil solution samples, in which concentrations remained below 1.5 mg L-1. Phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations outside the SMZ in treated-side IEM extracts showed significant increases after biosolids application, returning to near control levels after 1 yr. Phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations in IEM extracts were not different adjacent to the streams. Stream P, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations showed few differences downstream from the treatment with concentrations below 1.5 mg L-1. Our results indicate that at 15 in, SMZ protected streams from P, nitrate, and ammonium pollution for the first year after biosolids application to adjacent loblolly pine plantations in the Virginia Piedmont.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,38,5,,2106,2120,,10.2134/jeq2008.0350,,,,,,0047-2425; 1537-2537,,WOS:000269627400034
Fish,2009,"Rayner, Thomas S.; Jenkins, Kim M.; Kingsford, Richard T.","Small environmental flows, drought and the role of refugia for freshwater fish in the Macquarie Marshes, arid Australia","Fish in arid-zone rivers are dependent on waterholes for refuge during drought. In heavily regulated systems, water extraction for human use has the potential to exacerbate drought conditions and increase the reliance of fish on refugia. This study investigated this hypothesis by surveying fish communities at 25 sites in the Ramsar listed Macquarie Marshes, before and after a 23-GL environmental flow event. Although such flows are central to restoration efforts in the Murray-Darling Basin, limited water availability often forces water managers to make difficult triage decisions regarding which ecological assets to service. This study aimed to provide an update on the current health and status of native fish populations in the Macquarie Marshes and discuss how small flows may best be delivered to meet their ecological needs, particularly during droughts. Eight native species were collected, but they were outnumbered by three alien species by more than 3 : 1. Post-flooding recruitment was observed in most species and mean species richness of sampling sites increased significantly, as fish moved out of drought refugia to utilize a more diverse array of microhabitats. This study presents a conceptual model of fish use of refugia and recommends that key low-flow refugia be targeted for remediation efforts.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2009,"Roach, W. John; Grimm, Nancy B.",Nutrient Variation in an Urban Lake Chain and its Consequences for Phytoplankton Production,"In the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) ecosystem, managers divert mixed stream water and groundwater to maintain an artificial lake chain in Indian Bend Wash (IBW), a historically flashy, ephemeral, desert stream. Nutrient concentrations in the CAP ecosystem's groundwater, stream water, and floodwater differ: stream water has low concentrations of both inorganic N and P, while groundwater is low in inorganic P but rich in nitrate (NO(3)(-)). Consequently, groundwater contribution drives inorganic N concentrations in the lake chain. In contrast, floodwater typically has high P concentrations while remaining low in N. Thus we expected N and P concentrations in IBW lakes to vary with the mix of water flowing through them. Elevated NO(3)(-) and low inorganic P concentrations were predicted when groundwater pumping was pronounced and this prediction was supported. We hypothesized that these predictable changes in water chemistry would affect nutrient limitation of phytoplankton. Laboratory nutrient-addition bioassays demonstrated that phytoplankton growth was P-limited throughout the summer of 2003 when N/P was high. However, after a late-season flood drove N/P below 31:1, the expected threshold between N and P limitation, N limitation was observed. Our results indicate that effects of floods, the preeminent historic drivers of Sonoran Desert stream biogeochemistry, are mitigated in urban ecosystems by decisions about which spigots to turn. Consequently, nutrient limitation of urban streams is driven as much by management decisions as by natural hydrologic variation.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,38,4,,1429,1440,,10.2134/jeq2008.0191,,,,,,0047-2425,,WOS:000267719800009

Eighty-eight seasonal reference sites distributed into 23 basins were sampled on three occasions (spring summer and autumn of 2003), and 18 interannual reference sites distributed in 6 basins were sampled in the autumn of 2003, 2004 and 2005 to examine this temporal variability. Interannual reference sites were a Subset of seasonal reference sites. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) performed on Bray-Curtis similarity distances, using presence-absence data, showed no seasonal or interannual changes in the macroinvertebrate communities. The influence of seasonal and interannual variability was also tested in all the stream types using 18 macroinvertebrate metrics classified as richness, index, multimetric index, tolerance/intolerance and diversity. ANOVAs showed no seasonal differences in any of the studied metrics for temporary and evaporite calcareous at medium altitude and most of the metrics in the two headwaters stream types. This suggests the suitability of using a single season approach for the biomonitoring purposes of these metrics. Conversely, the seasonal differences detected in the metrics related with EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera) taxa in calcareous headwaters indicate possible differences in the relative presence of mcrohabitats (riffles and pools) as it result of flow variation. No interannual changes were detected in any of the metrics except EPT/OCH in siliceous headwaters. However, the large variability in the annual rainfall in this stud area suggests that this three-year study period may be too short to assess the effect of climatic variations oil the ecological status assessment. In general, the lower temporal variability (measured as seasonal and interannual coefficients of variation) of the taxon richness metric (S) and the two studied indices (IBMWP and IASPT), compared with the other metrics, make them a priori robust indicators to assess ecological status in Mediterranean streams.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,174,4,,353,367,,10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0174-0353,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000267180800008

Methods for selecting reference sites using a priori criteria have been proposed by many authors. A review of these criteria revealed that the most relevant criteria for streams and rivers were those related to riparian vegetation, diffuse and point sources of pollution, river morphology and hydrological conditions and regulation. In this work, we propose 20 criteria that reflect the characteristics of Mediterranean streams and their most frequent disturbances for the selection of reference sites in Mediterranean streams in Spain. We studied 162 sites located in 33 Mediterranean basins belonging to five stream types. Of the locations, 57% were selected as a priori reference sites by having applied the proposed criteria. Reference sites were identified for all stream types except for ""large watercourses"" which includes the lower reaches of some rivers in this study area. This a priori selection of reference sites was subjected to validation using the macroinvertebrate community by applying of an IBMWP threshold, which is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed sites in Mediterranean streams. This approach determined that whole of this selection (100%) could be considered valid reference sites. Furthermore, we identified differences in the reference conditions for each stream type on the basis of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,619,,,39,54,,10.1007/s10750-008-9580-0,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000261751000004

This may cause a sudden reduction of flow and fragmentation into isolated pools of permanently flowing streams, with a simultaneous increase in the food supply for detrivores during summer months. We performed a mesocosm study to investigate shredder and microbial mediated litter decomposition under these conditions. Leaf litter was placed in a lowland stream with a natural flow regime (reference) and in a stream mesocosm with significant flow reduction (FR) and a representative density of macroinvertebrates and detritus. Physicochemical parameters, leaf mass loss, macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass, leaf-associated respiration, fungal sporulation, and biomass were measured at regular intervals for 6 weeks. Coarse and fine-mesh bags were used to include or exclude macroinvertebrate shredders. In the coarse-mesh bags, leaf mass loss was significantly lower in the FR system than in the reference regime. In the fine-mesh bags, leaf respiration, fungal sporulation, and biomass but not leaf mass losses were substantially lower with flow reduction. Chironomid larvae (Micropsectra spp.) appeared to effectively fragment leaf litter in fine-mesh bags. In the FR system, leaf respiration was higher in the coarse-than in the fine-mesh bags.

Compared to surrounding dry soils these critical transition zones are highly productive and harbor a more diverse assemblage of soil animals, including rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes and microarthropods. Current cooling trends punctuated by warming events, and predicted future climate warming are expected to affect the hydrology of this region and thereby biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Above-ground communities are exposed to more variable temperature, relative humidity and greater UV radiation, and may be more vulnerable to climate change than sediments beneath, which are buffered from short-term changes. In this study, we compared above- and below-ground communities associated with either moss or cyanobacterial mats along glacial-fed streams and lakes differing in biological complexity (diversity, productivity and habitat suitability). All groups of soil fauna were more abundant in the above-ground material compared to the sediment beneath. Common indicators of habitat suitability (chlorophyll a, soil pH, soil salinity, and soil nitrogen) did not differ between vegetation types but were significantly different among sites. Variables most correlated with invertebrate abundances were sediment salinity, chlorophyll a content and nitrogen concentration.

Nitrogen and phosphorus were predominately found in the organic form and, despite the high suspended sediment transport, in the dissolved phase. Forest soil leaching and erosion fuelled the river with organic nutrients both in the dissolved and particulate phase, especially at the upstream portion of the basin. This part of the basin exhibited ""pristine"" dissolved nutrient levels (e.g. 30 mu g/l DIN, 1.04 mu g/l P-PO(4)), despite substantial transport through precipitation and subsurface flow, suggesting that certain biogeochemical processes acting in the watershed and in-stream effectively reduce riverine dissolved nutrient concentrations. Intense erosion caused a significant downstream increase of suspended sediments and associated nutrient concentrations. Flushing processes, that were detected even in a monthly base in particular river stretches, enhanced dissolved and particulate nutrient concentrations. Initial flood pulses created ""hot moments"" chiefly for suspended sediments (RMF during initial flood events reached up to 7) and associated nutrients (e.g. RMF of POC during initial flood events reached up to 32), although flood event sediments presented lower nutrient portions compared to usual sediment transport. Flush peaks of ammonia (max 19 mg/l NH(4)) and nitrite (max 42 mu g/l NO(2)), that surpassed aquatic quality standards, were attributed to rapid mineralization of organic matter upon rewetting and subsequent nitrification. River bed sediments were characterized by organic carbon and nitrogen losses, due to leaching and mineralization processes, and phosphorus retention, thus affecting nutrient ratios and hence photosynthesis in receiving waters.

C.","Impact of livestock management on water quality and streambank structure in a semi-arid, African ecosystem","Natural resource management may change local and regional ecosystems, especially in drought-prone environments. Livestock are commonly kept as a source of capital in agriculturally dominated communities in Southern Africa, but the mis-management of available forage and water resources has led to significant land and water degradation. In Northwest Zimbabwe, to reverse trends in environmental degradation a community-based conservation program was established that uses intensive Holistic Management Planned Grazing (HMPG) to restore lost habitat and re-establish natural vegetation. We examined riparian ecosystem structure and water quality to compare the environmental impact of this management to nearby communal lands during a drought. The results demonstrate that concentrating livestock on ephemeral stream standing pools results in reduced water quality and altered riparian ecosystem structure. These results were not significantly different from what was observed when wildlife utilized similar water resources without livestock influence. When water is scarce, as during extreme droughts, livestock usage of surface water resources must be weighted against community water needs. The long-term regional benefits of HMPG may prevail over short-term reductions in local water quality but more research is needed to assess all the consequences of such management.

Integrating research on hyporheic invertebrates with results from a long-term study of a UK river provided the opportunity to examine how benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate communities respond to inter-annual variability ill river flow and periods of groundwater drought. Changes in the riverine macroinvertebrate community associated with low flow included a reduction in species richness and the number of individuals per sample, particularly aquatic insects. The hyporheic community was characterized by a relatively homogeneous composition during a period of severe low flow, punctuated by short-term changes associated with variation in water temperature rather than changes in discharge. We present a conceptual model of the processes influencing benthic and hyporheic invertebrates under low-flow conditions. Previous studies have seldom integrated these two assemblages and their interactions. The model presented highlights the potential importance of surface water and hyporheic zone linkages for riverine invertebrate communities under a range of flow conditions.

Extreme summer flooding on the River Lathkill (Derbyshire, UK) provided the opportunity to examine the invertebrate community response to unseasonal spate flows, flow recession and, at temporary sites, streambed drying. Invertebrates were sampled at sites with differing flow permanence regimes during and after the spates. Following streambed drying at temporary sites, dewatered surface sediments were investigated as a refugium for aquatic invertebrates. Experimental rehydration of these dewatered sediments was conducted to promote development of desiccation-tolerant life stages. At perennial sites, spate flows reduced invertebrate abundance and diversity, whilst at temporary sites, flow reactivation facilitated rapid colonisation of the surface channel by a limited number of invertebrate taxa. Following streambed drying, 38 taxa were recorded from the dewatered and rehydrated sediments, with Oligochaeta being the most abundant taxon and Chironomidae (Diptera) the most diverse. Experimental rehydration of dewatered sediments revealed the presence of additional taxa, including Stenophylax sp. (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) and Nemoura sp. (Plecoptera: Nemouridae). The influence of flow permanence on invertebrate community composition was apparent despite the aseasonal high-magnitude flood events. Flow permanence was also critical in determining the community response to the spate flows. Following streambed drying at temporary sites, the surficial sediments overlying the karstic bedrock functioned as an effective refugium for several taxa. The development of aquatic insects following experimental rehydration indicated that these taxa survived in dewatered sediments as desiccation-resistant eggs.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,630,1,,299,312,,10.1007/s10750-009-9823-8,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000267030500023

The results of the first period of monitoring, summary, and perspectives are presented. The constructed wetland (CW) was built and the subsequent monitoring performed in the framework of the Southern Arava Sustainable Waste Management Plan, funded by the EU LIFE Fund. The specific aims were: (1) To end current sewage disposal and pollution of the ground, the aquifer, and the dry river bed (wadi) paths by biologically treating the sewage as part of the creation of a sustainable wetland ecosystem. (2) Serve as an example of CW in the Negev highlands and the Arava Valley climates for neighboring communities and as a test ground for plants and building methods appropriate to hyper arid climate. (3) Serve as an educational resource and tourist attraction for groups to learn about water reuse, recycling, local wildlife and migrating birds, including serving the heart of a planned Ecological-Educational Bird Park. This report is intended to allow others who are planning similar systems in hyper arid climates to learn from our experience.The project is located in an extreme arid desert with less than 40 mm of rain annually and temperature ranges of -5A degrees C to +42A degrees C. The site receives 165-185 m(3) of municipal and agricultural wastes daily, including cowshed and goat wastes and winery outflow.The CW establishment at Neot Smadar was completed in October 2006. For 8 months, clean water flowed through the system while the plants were taking root. In June 2007, the wetland was connected to the oxidation pond and full operation began. Because of seepage and evaporation, during the first several months, the water level was not high enough to allow free flow from one bed to the next. To bed A, the water was pumped periodically from the oxidation pond (Fig. 1) and from there flowed by gravitation through the rest of the system. The initial results of the monitoring are promising. In nearly all measurements, the system succeeded as expected to reduce levels of contaminants at least to the level acceptable for irrigating fruit trees and often to the level of unlimited irrigation. The introduction of the plants in the system and their physiological performance were evaluated and were found to correlate well to the quality of water in the various beds.It should be said at the outset that evaluation of the performance of a CW system is a long-term process. Thus, the main aim of this report is to present the problems, difficulties, preliminary results, and concepts concerned with the first stage of establishment of CW in an extremely dry region.The CW system was designed to dispose of municipal and agricultural wastes in a way that not merely reduces pollution, but adds to environmental quality by creating accessible parkland for local residents and tourists. Several factors affected the performance of the system at the initial stages of operation: ecological balance between microbes and plants, big seasonal variations, seepage and evaporation reduced the flow in the initial operation of the system. Despite the initial difficulties, the quality of water coming out the system is acceptable for irrigation.The CW can function well under extreme dryland conditions. The oxidation pond was the major source of evaporation and bad odors. Therefore, alternatives to the oxidation pond are needed. Cost effectiveness of the system still has to be evaluated systematically.",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,16,7,,862,875,,10.1007/s11356-009-0232-3,,,,,,0944-1344,,WOS:000271398300010

MRN is capable of simulating water quality in the aquatic and benthic phase and its development was especially focused on the reproduction of processes occurring in temporary river networks (flush events, pools formation, and transmission losses). Further, unlike many other models, it allows the quantification of settled materials at the channel bed also over periods when the river falls dry. These features are very important to secure mass conservation in highly varying flows of temporary rivers. The water quality models existing in MOHID are base on well-known ecological models, such as WASP and ERSEM, the latter allowing explicit parameterization of C, N, P, Si, and O cycles. MRN can be coupled to the basin model, MOHID Land, with computes runoff and porous media transport, allowing for the dynamic exchange of water and materials between the river and surroundings, or it can be used as a standalone model, receiving discharges at any specified nodes (ASCII files of time series with arbitrary time step).

Our aim was to explore among-stream differences in: (i) the magnitude and relative importance of NO3- retention (i. e. assimilatory uptake) and removal (i.e. denitrification), (ii) the relative contribution of the different primary uptake compartments to NO3- retention, and (iii) the regeneration, transformation and export pathways of the retained N.Streams varied strongly in NO3- concentration, which was highest in the agricultural stream and lowest in the forested stream. The agricultural stream also showed the lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and discharge. Standing stocks of primary uptake compartments were similar among streams and dominated by detritus compartments (i.e. fine and coarse benthic organic matter). Metabolism was net heterotrophic in all streams, although the degree of heterotrophy was highest in the agricultural stream.The NO3- uptake length was shortest in the agricultural stream, intermediate in the urban stream, and longest in the forested stream. Conversely, the NO3- mass- transfer velocity and the areal NO3- uptake rate were highest in the urban stream. Denitrification was not detectable in the forested stream, but accounted for 9% and 68% of total NO3- uptake in the urban and the agricultural stream, respectively. The relative contribution of detritus compartments to NO3- assimilatory uptake was greatest in the forested and lowest in the agricultural stream. In all streams, the retained N was rapidly regenerated back to the water column. Due to a strong coupling between regeneration and nitrification, most retained N was exported from the experimental reaches in the form of NO3-.This study provides evidence of fast in-stream N cycling, although the relative importance of N retention and removal varied considerably among streams. Results suggest that permanent NO3- removal via denitrification may be enhanced over temporary NO3- retention via assimilatory uptake in heterotrophic human-altered streams characterized by high NO3- and low DO concentrations.",BIOGEOSCIENCES,6,2,,181,196,,,,,,,,1726-4170,,WOS:000263839200005

In the fourth post-harvest water year annual rainfall was only 488 mm, which resulted in negligible run-off in all catchments, regardless of forest cover. In both plantation catchments, monthly streamflows increased significantly (p = 0.01, p < 0.001) due to a significant increase in baseflows (p < 0.001) after harvesting. Monthly stormflows were not significantly affected by harvesting. Flow duration curve analyses indicated a variable response between the two plantation catchments. Treated catchment A was converted from an ephemeral stream flowing 42% of the time pre-harvest to a temporary stream flowing 82% of the time post-harvest. These changes Occurred throughout all seasons of the year but were most pronounced during summer and autumn when baseflows were maintained post-harvest but were not observed under native forest or mature pine plantations. By contrast, flow duration increased in treated catchment B from 12% of the time pre-harvest to 38% of the time post-harvest with the greatest changes measured during the winter and spring months when streamflow would normally occur under native forest conditions. These observations have important implications for the development of models of plantation water use to be utilized in water resource planning in Australia.

Benjamin; Fellows, Christine S.; Conway, Carol L.; Hunter, Heather M.","Nitrate removal, denitrification and nitrous oxide production in the riparian zone of an ephemeral stream","Riparian zones are important features of the landscape that can buffer waterways from non-point sources of nitrogen pollution. Studies of perennial streams have identified denitrification as one of the dominant mechanisms by which this can occur. This study aimed to assess nitrate removal within the riparian zone of an ephemeral stream and characterise the processes responsible, particularly denitrification, using both in-situ and laboratory techniques. To quantify rates of groundwater nitrate removal and denitrification in-situ, nitrate was added to two separate injection-capture well networks in a perched riparian aquifer of a low order ephemeral stream in South East Queensland, Australia. Both networks also received bromide as a conservative tracer and one received acetylene to inhibit the last step of denitrification. An average of 77 +/- 2% and 98 +/- 1% of the added nitrate was removed within a distance of 40 cm from the injection wells (networks with acetylene and without, respectively). Based on rates of N(2)O production in the network with added acetylene, denitrification was not a major mechanism of nitrate loss, accounting for only 3% of removal. Reduction of nitrate to ammonium was also not a major pathway in either network, contributing <4%. Relatively high concentrations of oxygen in the aquifer following recent filling by stream water may have reduced the importance of these two anaerobic pathways. Alternatively, denitrification may have been underestimated using the in-situ acetylene block technique. In the laboratory. soils taken from two depths at each well network were incubated with four nitrate-N treatments (ranging from ambient concentration to an addition of 15 mg N l(-1)), with and without added acetylene. Potential rates of denitrification, N(2)O production and N(2)O:N(2) ratios increased with nitrate additions, particularly in shallow soils. Potential rates of denitrification observed in the laboratory were equivalent in magnitude to nitrate removal measured in the field I:mean 0.26 +/- 0.12 mg N kg of dry soil(-1) d(-1)), but were two orders of magnitude greater than denitrification measured in the field with added acetylene. The relative importance of assimilatory vs. dissimilatory processes of nitrate removal depends on environmental conditions in the aquifer, particularly hydrology and its effects on dissolved oxygen concentrations. Depending on seasonal conditions, aquifers of ephemeral streams like the study site are likely to fluctuate between oxic and anoxic conditions; nevertheless they may still function as effective buffers. While denitrification to N(2) is a desirable outcome from a management perspective, assimilation into biomass can provide a rapid sink for nitrate, thus helping to reduce short-term delivery of nitrate downstream. Longer-term studies are needed to determine the overall effectiveness of riparian buffers associated with ephemeral streams in mitigating nitrate loads reaching downstream ecosystems.

Biogeochemistry,2010,"Acuna, V.",Flow regime alteration effects on the organic C dynamics in semiarid stream ecosystems,"There is evidence of an ongoing alteration of the flow regime owing to climate change forcing, which has resulted in substantial increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts. Such changes in the flow regime may have major implications in freshwater ecosystems and, in particular, in the organic carbon dynamics in semiarid stream ecosystems. Much is known about the role of extreme flow events on structuring stream ecosystems, but few studies explored the effects of extreme flow events magnitude, timing, and sequence on stream ecosystems. To assess the effect of extreme events on stream organic C dynamics, a simple and flexible modeling approach was applied to simulate the organic carbon dynamics in a simplified river reach. The river reach model was initially calibrated and tested using long-term data for stream water velocity and amount of organic carbon in sediment. After that, multiple scenarios differing in the extreme flow events (floods and droughts) sequence and magnitude were used to simulate the effects of possible flow regime changes on the stream organic carbon dynamics. Initial expectations were that: (i) an increase in the magnitude or frequency of extreme flow events would reduce the amount of organic carbon respired within the simulated river reach, and (ii) relationship between the timings of the extreme flow events and of the litterfall input would influence considerably the effects of the extreme flow events. Results pointed out that: (i) the amount of processed carbon respect the amount entering the ecosystem was affected by extreme events such floods and droughts, but the relevance of those events differed along the year, with a maximal effect during the litterfall period; (ii) extreme event timing rather than the magnitude was more relevant to the stream organic carbon dynamics; and (iii) the amount of respired carbon in the ecosystem could be amplified or reduced depending on event sequence. Increasing awareness of the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle and the shaping role of hydrology on the stream organic carbon dynamics stress the need to better quantify carbon fluxes and the hydrological controls on these fluxes.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,657,1,,233,242,,10.1007/s10750-009-0084-3,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000282323300016
Biogeochemistry,2010,"Acuna, V.; Tockner, K.",The effects of alterations in temperature and flow regime on organic carbon dynamics in Mediterranean river networks,"It is only recently that freshwaters have been identified as important quantitative components of the carbon (C) cycle at global and regional scales. To date there are no studies that quantitatively predict the effects of alterations in temperature and flow regimes, individually, or in concert, on organic C dynamics in streams. To address this need, we applied a mechanistic model to simulate organic C dynamics in Mediterranean river networks under 27 different scenarios of altered temperature and flow regimes. We predict that the organic C dynamics in freshwaters in the Mediterranean, as well as in other semiarid regions, will be highly sensitive to global climate change owing to major increases in the degree of intermittency as well as in flood frequency and magnitude. Results indicate that flow regime alterations increase C export rates, whereas temperature alterations increase instream metabolism of organic C. However, flow regime alterations exhibit a much greater influence on C dynamics than do changes in the temperature regime. Reservoirs partly counteract the effects of flow extremes on C export rates, and their role in the C dynamics increases with increasing flow variability. The present study is one of the first studies to quantify the complex interactions between the flow and the temperature regime on C dynamics, emphasizing the key role of extreme events such as dry periods and floods, compared with overall trend effects. This information is pivotal in understanding the impact of future climate change on global C dynamics.",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,16,9,,2638,2650,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02170.x,,,,,,1354-1013,,WOS:000280633700019
Assessment,2010,"Alderwish, Ahmed Mohamed","Induced recharge at new dam sites-Sana'a Basin, Yemen","In approaching the task of developing recharge estimates for dam sites, several constraints are apparent, including the scarcity of site-specific data for the selected new sites and the availability of simple yet robust analysis techniques. Combined, these constraints require an approach which involves best use of available data, adoption of relatively simple analytical approximations of reality, and the adoption of several key assumptions. In arid country with limited resources, two simple techniques have been used for recharge estimation: (1) a simple water balance model in spreadsheet and (2) a more refined Darcian approach involving an analytical approximation of a flow-net solution. By applying the two models at three new dam sites, the amount of recharge rates calculated over the period 2007-2026 was close. This is because, despite Darcian approach that should have affected the recharge rate as other parameters were introduced in the calculation of q (t) , e.g., groundwater table mound, reservoir water height, etc., the results show general agreement between the two methods which seem to validate the assumptions made in both methods. A general conclusion of this comparison is that the hydraulic conductivity (K) is the main determining factor in recharge calculations in these situations. The water balance model was used to estimate recharge at Wadi Bahaman, under gravity and cascade dams' scenarios. Using gravity dam at Wadi Bahaman for groundwater recharge proved not suitable based on the relatively small predicted runoff from a small catchment area and geological concerns in the abutment areas. Instead, a series of three low check dams (2 to 4 m high) was proposed. These check dams will slow down the runoff flow, form small reservoirs, and enhance recharge along the valley, without requiring expensive foundations. Estimated groundwater recharge under cascade dams (141,407 m(3)/year) is greater than recharge estimated for gravity dam (103,853 m(3)/year) by at least 36%.",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,3,3,,283,293,,10.1007/s12517-009-0075-8,,,,,,1866-7511,,WOS:000279682500006

The aim of this project was to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic pathways of phosphorus uptake by epilithic communities in un-modified and modified streams. This was investigated through a series of filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP)-uptake experiments in two streams of the Torrens River Catchment, South Australia. Total benthic FRP uptake was assessed as the loss of FRP to unsterilized epilithic communities (k(T)), abiotic uptake was the loss to sterilized epilithic communities (k(A)) and biotic uptake (k(B)) was the difference between total and abiotic uptake. It was hypothesized that un-modified reaches would have higher k(A) and k(B) than degraded and engineered reaches. Overall, k(T), k(A) and k(B) were greatest in un-modified reaches, but this pattern was not consistent across seasons. k(T) and k(B) were greatest in the un-modified reaches in autumn-winter and late spring, but not in winter-spring. Differences in k(B) were best explained by phosphorus availability in the water column and the period of continuous flow. k(A) was greatest in the un-modified reaches in autumn-winter, greatest in the degraded reaches in winter-spring, but similar in the un-modified reaches and degraded reaches in late spring. k(A) was most dependent upon the background FRP concentration, but also the attached organic matter in the un-modified reaches. The project demonstrated that several impacts of changes in land-use can alter the affinity of biotic and abiotic processes for phosphorus, which will have implications for in-stream nutrient availability and downstream ecosystems.

The drainage area was significantly correlated to all the genetic diversity indices, pointing to the need to control for this effect in comparing populations with different histories and paleoecologies. A significant correlation was also found between genetic diversity and the morphoclimatic regions to which the rivers were assigned, with the highest diversity in warmer, lower latitude, Mediterranean-type streams. This relationship was not due to idiosyncratic characteristics of the clades compared. When the drainage area and phylogenetic effects were removed, the southern Mediterranean streams harboured significantly more genetic diversity even when compared with much larger northern streams. It is argued that these results are likely caused both by the metapopulation structure of the Mediterranean streams and by the severe reduction or local extinction of populations in the northern rivers during glaciations.

The most popular method used to measure nutrient retention efficiency is constant rate addition (CRA), although studies using pulse addition (PA) as an alternative have been published. The similarities of the results produced by the two methods have not yet been explored. With the aim of clarifying this uncertainty, the present study assessed the similarities between the results of the CRA and PA experiments. Thirteen phosphate CRA-PA paired additions were performed in two different Mediterranean streams. We used ANOVA to compare the results of the uptake rate coefficients from the CRA (K(tCRA)) and the PA (K(tPA)) experiments. Results from CRA and PA were significantly different, with K(tCRA) being higher than K(tPA) in most cases, however, the difference between K(tCRA) and K(tPA) decreased as specific water residence time increased. When specific water residence time exceeded a specific threshold value, they became equal ( K(tCRA approximate to) K(tPA)). Results suggested that the differences in nutrient retention estimates between the two methods may be a consequence of the difference in solute spreading along the stream reaches that shape the duration and magnitude of solute interaction across the surface water and stream-bed interface.

We investigated both processes on a regulated Sonoran Desert stream, using the criterion that average current velocity is <0.2 m s(-1) in a lentic reach. We estimated temporal change in the lotic : lentic stream length ratio by relating beaver pond length (determined by the upstream lentic-lotic boundary position) to dam size, and coupling that to the dam-size frequency distribution and repeated censuses of dams along the 58-km river. The ratio fell from 19: 1 when no beaver dams were present to <3 : 1 after 7 years of flows favourable for beaver. We investigated the dam failure-flood intensity relationship in three independent trials (experimental floods) featuring peak discharge ranging from 37 to 65 m(3) s(-1). Major damage (breach >= 3-m wide) occurred at >= 20% of monitored dams (n = 7-86) and a similar or higher proportion was moderately damaged. We detected neither a relationship between dam size and damage level nor a flood discharge threshold for initiating major damage. Dam constituent materials appeared to control the probability of major damage at low (attenuated) flood magnitude. We conclude that environmental flows prescribed to sustain desert riparian forest will also reduce beaver-created lentic habitat in a non-linear manner determined by both beaver dam and flood attributes. Consideration of both desirable and undesirable consequences of ecological engineering by beaver is important when optimizing environmental flows to meet ecological and socioeconomic goals.

Water analysis in downstream sampling points showed reductions of 91.7% in biological oxygen demand, 87.7% in chemical oxygen demand, 73.9% in total nitrogen, and 72.8% in total ammonia nitrogen. Significant AOP levels in the sediment were detected mainly in the fall and spring seasons. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of AOB 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that in most sampling points, the streambed was dominated by Nitrosospira cluster 3 strains similar to those dominating the stream bank's soils and sediments in nearby springs. Nitrosomonas strains introduced by discharged wastewater and others dominated some sections of the stream characterized by high organic carbon levels. The results suggest that climatic conditions in the Negev desert select for AOB belonging to Nitrosospira cluster 3, and these conditions dominate the aquatic environment effect along most of the stream sections. In addition, the nitrification-denitrification processes were not sufficient to reduce nitrogen levels in the sediment and prevent the eutrophication of some sections of the stream ecosystem.

The gradient was characterized with modeled and measured hydrologic, chemical, and physical environmental variables. The invertebrates were collected in the Selwyn River, southeastern New Zealand, at multiple sites in each of 4 river sections with distinct hydrological conditions (perennial-losing, ephemeral, intermittent, perennial-gaining). Values of hydrological metrics for each site were generated with an empirical model developed for the Selwyn River. The metrics included 4 that characterized intermittent flow (flow permanence, flow duration, drying frequency, distance to nearest perennial site). Most invertebrate richness and density metrics were significantly higher in the perennial-losing and perennial-gaining sections than in the ephemeral and intermittent sections. A principle components analysis (PCA) separated invertebrate samples from the 4 sections along 2 primary factors. Nine of 13 hydrological metrics, including the 4 intermittence metrics, were correlated with the PCA site scores. Linear regressions indicated that most taxon-richness metrics and some density metrics were related to flow permanence, flow duration, or both. Based on the regression analysis, we predicted that 1.9 taxa/m(2) are added with each 10% increase in flow permanence, and 0.5 taxa/m(2) are added with each 10-d increase in flow duration. Results from a nestedness analysis indicated that communities at ephemeral and intermittent sites were nested subsets of the communities at perennial sites, and the nesting order of sites was related to both flow permanence and flow duration. Assemblages of taxa with particular life-history traits (life span, fecundity, maximum size, and voltinism) varied linearly with flow permanence and flow duration. The variation in invertebrate communities along the Selwyn River was primarily the result of progressive removal of desiccation-sensitive taxa with increasing intermittence, not to selection for desiccation-resistant specialists.

Multivariate ordination techniques and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to decompose species-environment relationships into a hierarchically structured data set, and to determine factors explaining changes in fish assemblage structure and species losses over a single dry season. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74% of fish assemblage change in terms of waterhole morphology (wetted perimeter, depth), habitat structure (bench development, off-take channels), waterhole quality (eroded banks, gross primary production), the size of surrounding floodplains and the relative isolation of waterholes. Classification trees for endemic and restricted species reaffirmed the importance of these waterhole and floodplain variables as drivers of fish losses.

This paper reports on the suitability of the FRAI for the non-perennial Seekoei River and discusses some of the challenges faced. Our relatively long and thorough study on the Seekoei River confirmed the concerns that earlier, snapshot, fish integrity assessments in the Orange River system raised: that the existing fish indices are not ideally suited for these rivers with their naturally low species richness and hardy, generalist fish communities. Other difficulties with the use of a score-based method include prediction of the expected species, calculation of a frequency of occurrence rating, selection of the right sampling times for comparative purposes, loss of habitats and sampling points under different flow conditions, and problems experienced when using accumulated data to try to correct for a situation of having too few sampling points. At this stage a more generalised approach is suggested for the Seekoei River, and ultimately other similar non-perennial systems.

In this study, we examined fish species richness and presence-absence in pools of an intermittent river system containing underground water storages (Fortescue River, north-west Australia), a system that was predicted to uncouple this relationship. Stability, measured by pool persistence, was unrelated to a pool's maximum depth or its position in the catchment, indicating partial decoupling. However, pool stability remained correlated with habitat diversity and log-transformed surface area. Model selection indicated that species richness was better described by pool stability and the landscape factor stream order than by within-pool habitat descriptors. Permanent pools low in the catchment contained more species than unstable pools in headwater streams. We conclude that the distribution of fish in the Fortescue River is shaped predominantly by processes of extirpation and re-colonisation.

After the construction of the La Cierva reservoir in the Mu la stream, the flow regime has been progressively altered in parallel with the expansion of irrigated agriculture in the watershed. The current regime shows a significant reduction in the magnitude of flows and a reversal of the seasonal pattern, with droughts during winter instead of summer months becoming more frequent and long-lasting. Different EFRs are presented for three conservation scenarios of natural flow regimes in wet, average and dry years.

Water abstraction strongly affects streams in arid and semiarid ecosystems, particularly where there is a Mediterranean climate. Excessive abstraction reduces the availability of water for human uses downstream and impairs the capacity of streams to support native biota.2. We investigated the flow regime and related variables in six river basins of the Iberian Peninsula and show that they have been strongly altered, with declining flows (autoregressive models) and groundwater levels during the 20th century. These streams had lower flows and more frequent droughts than predicted by the official hydrological model used in this region. Three of these rivers were sometimes dry, whereas there were predicted by the model to be permanently flowing. Meanwhile, there has been no decrease in annual precipitation.3. We also investigated the fish assemblage of a stream in one of these river basins (Tordera) for 6 years and show that sites more affected by water abstraction display significant differences in four fish metrics (catch per unit effort, number of benthic species, number of intolerant species and proportional abundance of intolerant individuals) commonly used to assess the biotic condition of streams.4. We discuss the utility of these metrics in assessing impacts of water abstraction and point out the need for detailed characterisation of the natural flow regime (and hence drought events) prior to the application of biotic indices in streams severely affected by water abstraction. In particular, in cases of artificially dry streams, it is more appropriate for regulatory agencies to assign index scores that reflect biotic degradation than to assign 'missing' scores, as is presently customary in assessments of Iberian streams.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,3,,628,642,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02299.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000274814100010

Reported abstraction of 4.6 Mm(3) per year is primarily consumed in the town of Walvis Bay, although the groundwater decay (pumping and natural losses along the period 1983-2005) was estimated in 14.8 Mm(3) per year. Recharge is variable, occurring in 11 out of 13 years in the middle Kuiseb River, but only in 11 out of 28 years in the middle-lower reaches. In contrast, the Buffels River has relatively minor alluvial aquifers (similar to 11 Mm(3)) and recharge sources derive from both lateral subsurface flow and floodwater infiltration, the latter limited to a recharge maximum of 1.3 Mm(3) during floods occurring once every four years. Current abstractions to supply the adjacent rural population and a few small-scale, irrigated commercial farms are 0.15 Mm(3) yr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), well within the long-term sustainable yield estimated to be 0.7 Mm(3) yr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Since independence in 1990, Namibia's water resource management approach has focussed on ephemeral river basin management of which the Kuiseb Basin Management Committee (KBMC) is a model. Here, some water points are managed independently by rural communities through committees while the national bulk water supplier provides for Walvis Bay Municipality from the lower aquifers. This provides a sense of local ownership through local participation between government, NGOs and CBOs (community-based organisations) in the planning and implementation of IWRM. Despite the potential for water resource development in the lower Buffels River, the scope for implementing IWRM is limited not only by the small aquifer size, but also because basin management in South Africa is considered only in the context of perennial rivers. Since 2001, water service delivery in the Buffels River catchment has become the responsibility of two newly created local municipalities. As municipal government gains experience, skills and capacity, its ability to respond to local needs related to water service delivery will be accomplished through local participation in the design and implementation of annual 'integrated development plans'. These two case studies demonstrate that a variety of IWRM strategies in the drylands of developing countries are appropriate depending on scales of governance, evolving policy frameworks, scales of need and limitations inherent in the hydrological processes of groundwater resources.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,24,4,,641,667,,10.1007/s11269-009-9463-9,,,,,,0920-4741,,WOS:000274438200003

Rates of whole-system metabolism (production and respiration) are fundamental indicators of ecosystem structure and function. Although first-order, proximal controls are well understood, assessments of the interactions between proximal controls and distal controls, such as land use and geographic region, are lacking. Thus, the influence of land use on stream metabolism across geographic regions is unknown. Further, there is limited understanding of how land use may alter variability in ecosystem metabolism across regions.2. Stream metabolism was measured in nine streams in each of eight regions (n = 72) across the United States and Puerto Rico. In each region, three streams were selected from a range of three land uses: agriculturally influenced, urban-influenced, and reference streams. Stream metabolism was estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in each stream reach with correction for reaeration and groundwater input.3. Gross primary production (GPP) was highest in regions with little riparian vegetation (sagebrush steppe in Wyoming, desert shrub in Arizona/New Mexico) and lowest in forested regions (North Carolina, Oregon). In contrast, ecosystem respiration (ER) varied both within and among regions. Reference streams had significantly lower rates of GPP than urban or agriculturally influenced streams.4. GPP was positively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and autotrophic biomass. Multiple regression models compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) indicated GPP increased with water column ammonium and the fraction of the catchment in urban and reference land-use categories. Multiple regression models also identified velocity, temperature, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, GPP, coarse benthic organic matter, fine benthic organic matter and the fraction of all land-use categories in the catchment as regulators of ER.5. Structural equation modelling indicated significant distal as well as proximal control pathways including a direct effect of land-use on GPP as well as SRP, DIN, and PAR effects on GPP; GPP effects on autotrophic biomass, organic matter, and ER; and organic matter effects on ER.6. Overall, consideration of the data separated by land-use categories showed reduced inter-regional variability in rates of metabolism, indicating that the influence of agricultural and urban land use can obscure regional differences in stream metabolism.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,9,,1874,1890,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02422.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000280997300006

Approximately 70% of east-central Indiana landuse is rowcrop agriculture with widespread Stream channelization. We sampled fishes and invertebrates at 14 sites in seven headwater streams in the Buck Creek watershed. We defined streams that dry in late summer and early fall as seasonal, and those that maintain flow throughout the year as perennial streams. Our predictions were that alterations to the natural channel structure, which change the seasonal drying patterns of the streams, would also cause changes in fish and invertebrate assemblages.

During 2008 an exceptionally long drought in NE Spain was irregularly interrupted by rainfall events. We analyzed the relationships between the biological community structure with the ongoing and preceding hydrological patterns during the drought and recovery periods. We aimed: (1) to assess the role of hydrology on different biological assemblages (diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish), (2) to determine which measures of community structure could be better related to hydrology, and (3) to determine the effects of water abstraction on river communities. Three subsets of variables (hydrological, spatial and environmental) were selected to determine the relative importance of hydrological alterations. Variation partitioning analysis and ordination methods were used to determine which subset of variables had higher effects on 20 parameters and six matrices (taxonomic and functional) of the biological communities. The analyses revealed that both parameters and matrices were significantly related to hydrological effects.

For the purposes of this study, three gaging stations were installed along Vosvozis river, where water quantity and quality measurements were conducted for the period August 2005 to November 2006. Water discharge, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured in situ using appropriate equipment. The collected water samples were analyzed in the laboratory for the determination of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium nitrogen, total Kjeldalh nitrogen (TKN), orthophosphate (OP), total phosphorus (TP), COD, and BOD. Agricultural diffuse sources provided the major source of nitrate nitrogen loads during the wet period. During the dry period (from June to October), the major nutrient (N, P) and COD, BOD sources were point sources. The trophic status of Vosvozis river during the monitoring period was determined as eutrophic, based on Dodds classification scheme. Moreover, the SWAT model was used to simulate hydrographs and nutrient loads. SWAT was validated with the measured data. Predicted hydrographs and pollutographs were plotted against observed values and showed good agreement. The validated model was used to test eight alternative scenarios concerning different cropping management approaches. The results of these scenarios indicate that nonpoint source pollution is the prevailing type of pollution in the study area.

The quantification of these variables is often performed through accurate measuring or detailed estimation, but their assessment is not always feasible for river management purposes. Economic and time constraints often lead to difficulty in creating simple summaries of collected data for practical use. The Lentic-lotic River Descriptor (LRD) was developed to identify the character of a river site in terms of local hydraulic conditions. Information about the presence of flow types, channel substrates, in-stream vegetation, organic debris and artificial features is included in its calculation. The main aim of this paper is to investigate whether the lentic-lotic character of a river site, as summarized with the LRD descriptor, is relevant to aquatic invertebrate communities in nearly natural river sites. Invertebrate data were collected with multi-habitat, proportional sampling and hydromorphological information was gained by applying the CARAVAGGIO method (river habitat survey technique) in the field. The dataset was generated from High or Good ecological status river sites located in Mediterranean areas of Italy. Correspondence Analysis was performed to relate the invertebrate community structure to a set of catchment-scale, reach-scale and chemical environmental variables. The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that LRD provides a persuasive explanation of the most important axis of variation in benthic data.

Assessment,2010,"Caruso, Brian S.; Haynes, Joshua",Connectivity and Jurisdictional Issues for Rocky Mountains and Great Plains Aquatic Resources,"Understanding the connectivity between wetlands and headwater intermittent and ephemeral streams with downstream navigable waters has become a critical focus for U.S. Clean Water Act protection.

For jurisdictional determinations (JDs) of waters considered to be 'geographically isolated' or requiring an evaluation of their 'significant nexus' to navigable waters, coordination between the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (COE) is required. EPA Region 8 evaluated all coordinated JDs during the first year of guidance implementation from June 2007 to June 2008. The region includes the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and parts of the Colorado Plateau, including portions of 20 Level III Ecoregions. Approximately 54% of all stream miles are 1st-order channels, and 77% are intermittent. During the period, JDs for 1,265 individual waters from three COE districts were evaluated, resulting in 793 wetlands, 12 streams, and 18 water bodies considered non-jurisdictional due to isolation.

Possible impacts of water-resource development on assemblages of freshwater macroinvertebrates were investigated in the upper Darling River and some of its tributaries in north-western New South Wales (Australia), an arid and semi-arid region of low relief where alteration of river flows has intensified through expansion of irrigated agriculture.2. Study sites were grouped into four hydrological regimes resulting from impoundment, flow regulation, water abstraction and natural variation, namely (i) intermittent flow with relatively little hydrological alteration from water-resource development, (ii) intermittent flow with substantial alteration, (iii) near-perennial flow with substantial alteration but unimpounded and (iv) near-perennial flow with substantial alteration plus impoundment by weirs that stabilise water levels.3. Macroinvertebrates were sampled with three methods (a quantitative cylinder sampler, handnet sampling and baited traps) in three periods with differing hydrology (recessional low flow in June 2003, high flow in March 2004 and increasing flow after drought in December 2004).4. Taxonomic richness, assemblage composition and catch per unit effort of the crayfish Cherax destructor differed significantly among the site groups, but total macroinvertebrate density and the AUSRIVAS O/E (Australian River Assessment System observed-over-expected) index did not. The principal spatial differences were between the intermittent and near-perennial rivers, and apparent effects of water-resource development and impoundment were more subtle. Temporal differences in richness, abundance and composition were substantial and appeared to be related mainly to variations in discharge and temperature.5. Current macroinvertebrate-based methods for assessing the 'condition' or 'health' of Australian dryland rivers are inadequate. Such assessments might be improved with (i) reference data that take adequate account of antecedent hydrological conditions, (ii) consideration of long-term taxonomic richness as well as richness on individual sampling occasions, (iii) evaluation of invertebrate population sizes, (iv) analysis of assemblage data by trait composition and (v) adoption of the genus as the default level of taxonomic resolution.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,8,,1780,1800,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02403.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000279734300016

Whether intermittent and ephemeral streams have a lower diversity and (or) unique assemblage structure relative to physically similar and nearby perennial streams is still debated. We investigated changes in the diversity and assemblage composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates occupying debris dams in three headwater streams with a gradient of flow permanence (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral) during a dry period in the austral summer of 2007 and a wet period in the spring of 2008. In the dry period, mean taxon richness and abundance in debris dams were lower in the intermittent and ephemeral streams than in the perennial stream, and the length of time without connected surface flow appeared to produce different patterns in community composition. However, during the wet period, mean taxon richness, abundance, and community composition of macroinvertebrates were very similar among the three streams. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling showed evidence for a strong effect of permanence on taxon richness, abundance, and evenness within debris dams. Taxa from the perennial stream were extremely efficient at colonizing seasonally dry nearby streams. Differences in assemblage structure between these temporary and permanent headwater streams may only arise seasonally and also appear related to flow permanence.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,67,10,,1649,1657,,10.1139/F10-087,,,,,,0706-652X; 1205-7533,,WOS:000282589200008

Here, we describe the geographical patterns in the incidence of threats affecting mediterranean freshwater fish and test whether the effects of specific threats are spatially related to the degree of imperilment of fish faunas.LocationThe Mediterranean Basin Biome.MethodsFrom the IUCN Red List, we recorded the six main threats to 232 endemic freshwater fish species. We used data on fish distributions from IUCN to characterize the spatial patterns in the incidence of threats (as percentage of species affected) through multivariate statistics. We studied the relationships between threat incidence and two estimators of imperilment (proportion of species threatened and an index of extinction risk) at two spatial scales (10 x 10 km and basins) using partial least squares regressions (PLSR) that incorporated the effects of species richness and mean range size.ResultsThe main axis of variation in the incidence of threats to freshwater fish split areas mainly affected by invasive species from those areas where species are threatened by pollution and agriculture. Wherever invasive species and water extraction were predominant threats, fish assemblages consistently tended to be more imperilled.Main conclusionsAs far as we know, this is the first large-scale analysis on the spatial relationships between the incidence of threats and level of imperilment of any taxonomic group. Our results highlight the primary role of invasive species and water extraction as drivers of native fish declines in the Mediterranean Basin. Large-scale patterns described here should be generated by local-scale impacts of both threats on fish biodiversity, widely reported in Mediterranean areas. Because all the species under concern are endemic, control of invasive species and reducing overexploitation of freshwater resources should be conservation priorities for mediterranean freshwater systems.",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,16,5,,744,754,,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00680.x,,,,,,1366-9516,,WOS:000280973100004

Modified flow regimes are hypothesised to facilitate invasions by alien fish but in unregulated dryland rivers, large floods provide a recruitment advantage for native over alien species whereas droughts favour alien species. We tested these hypotheses by using data from a 3-year study (2000-2003) of fish populations in the unmodified rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) of Australia. Results from a lower reach of Cooper Creek were compared with those of an earlier study (1986-1992). During both periods, large floods occurred, with return periods ranging from >1 in 5 to >1 in 25 years. In the lower Cooper, decreases in the abundance of alien species relative to native species, and dramatic increases in recruitment of native species, were observed during a 1-3-year period following large floods. In two other rivers in 2000-2003, there was no statistically significant change in the already low abundances of alien species. We suggest that the naturally variable hydrological regimes and native-dominant fish assemblages of the unregulated LEB rivers afford some resistance to the establishment and proliferation of alien fish through flood and drought conditions.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,8,,857,863,,10.1071/MF09090,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000280848200004

S. streams,"Canalization and incision are common morphological alterations associated with human land use that reduce hydrological/hydrodynamic linkages between surface and ground waters in stream ecosystems. To explore the impacts of these anthropogenic changes on nutrient spiraling in streams, we measured the linkage between hyporheic and surface zones of reference and human-altered streams using (15)N-nitrate ((15)NO(3)(-)) and bromide (Br(-)) tracer injection experiments. Experiments were conducted in 7 streams (3 reference, 3 agricultural and 1 urban) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, over a 3 yr period during the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX II). Groundwater wells (6-9 in each stream) were inserted to 30 cm depth and multilevel samplers (MLS) were installed downstream from injection sites to measure inorganic nitrogen (N) and Br(-) concentrations in hyporheic water. There was measurable surface water-ground water (SW-GW) connectivity, as indicated by Br(-) concentrations in shallow alluvial ground water (0-30 cm depth) at all sites. SW-GW connectivity was higher in reference than in human-altered streams. Concentrations of NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) in MLS cells (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm below streambed) were inversely correlated, and (15)N-enrichment of both N species was measurable in groundwater wells. Hyporheic zones with lower surface-water infiltration had higher quantities of (15)NH(4)(+) than of (15)NO(3)(-). Whole stream uptake (k(tot); calculated during the LINX II experiments) was correlated with delta(15)NH(4)(+) in wells; i.e., high delta(15)NH(4)(+) in wells was associated with high stream uptake, and both whole stream NO(3)(-) uptake and delta(15)NH(4)(+) were highest in the human-altered streams. The presence of enriched (15)NH(4)(+) in many of the wells within 24 h of injection suggested that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was occurring in the hyporheic zone.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,176,4,,391,405,,10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0391,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000281759300009

To reduce the effects of poor taxonomic resolution, we used a dataset with most taxa identified to the genus or species level. We predicted that annelid assemblages would vary in structure and composition along FP gradients due to differences in desiccation resistance between taxa. We also predicted that groundwater-fed (gaining) and runoff-fed (losing) river sections would be inhabitated by dissimilar annelid assemblages due to differences in river-aquifer connections and recolonization sources. We found a negative relationship between taxon richness and FP, indicating that, on average, two annelid taxa are lost from hyporheic assemblages in the Selwyn River with every 10% decrease in FP. Low FP appears to favour annelid taxa that tolerate moist or dry conditions in sediments, as shown by a negative relationship between FP and the proportion of desiccation-tolerant taxa. A high proportion of hypogean taxa distinguished the groundwater-fed and perennial-gaining reach from the other reaches. In spite of the large differences in physical structure between the intermittent-gaining and the ephemeral-losing reach, we found few between-reach differences in annelid assemblages and, in particular, no differences in % hypogean taxa. These varied results illustrate the need to employ both categorical and continuous variables in ecological analyses: the combined categorical and gradient approach used in the present study is likely to explain more variability than either univariate approach alone.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,72,3,,335,346,,10.1007/s00027-010-0139-6,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000278110400008
Assessment,2010,"Davis, Jenny; Sim, Lien; Chambers, Jane",Multiple stressors and regime shifts in shallow aquatic ecosystems in antipodean landscapes,"1. Changes in land management (land use and land cover) and water management (including extraction of ground water and diversion of surface waters for irrigation) driven by increases in agricultural production and urban expansion (and fundamentally by population growth) have created multiple stressors on global freshwater ecosystems that we can no longer ignore.2. The development and testing of conceptual ecological models that examine the impact of stressors on aquatic ecosystems, and recognise that responses may be nonlinear, is now essential for identifying critical processes and predicting changes, particularly the possibility of catastrophic regime shifts or 'ecological surprises'.3. Models depicting gradual ecological change and three types of regime shift (simple thresholds, hysteresis and irreversible changes) were examined in the context of shallow inland aquatic ecosystems (wetlands, shallow lakes and temporary river pools) in southwestern Australia subject to multiple anthropogenic impacts (hydrological change, eutrophication, salinisation and acidification).4. Changes in hydrological processes, particularly the balance between groundwater-dominated versus surface water-dominated inputs and a change from seasonal to permanent water regimes appeared to be the major drivers influencing ecological regime change and the impacts of eutrophication and acidification (in urban systems) and salinisation and acidification (in agricultural systems).5. In the absence of hydrological change, urban wetlands undergoing eutrophication and agricultural wetlands experiencing salinisation appeared to fit threshold models. Models encompassing alternative regimes and hysteresis appeared to be applicable where a change from a seasonal to permanent hydrological regime had occurred.6. Irreversible ecological change has potentially occurred in agricultural landscapes because the external economic driver, agricultural productivity, persists independently of the impact on aquatic ecosystems.7. Thematic implications: multiple stressors can create multiple thresholds that may act in a hierarchical fashion in shallow, lentic systems. The resulting regime shifts may follow different models and trajectories of recovery. Challenges for ecosystem managers and researchers include determining how close a system may be to critical thresholds and which processes are essential to maintaining or restoring the system. This requires an understanding of both external drivers and internal ecosystem dynamics, and the interactions between them, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,,,5,18,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02376.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000273687100002

An Analysis of Wastewater Management in an Arid Transboundary Case,"The basin scale has been promoted universally as the optimal management unit that allows for the internalization of all external effects caused by multiple water uses. However, the basin scale has been put forward largely on the basis of experience in temperate zones. Hence whether the basin scale is the best scale for management in other settings remains questionable. To address these questions this paper analyzes the economic viability and the political feasibility of alternative management options in the Kidron/Wadi Nar region. The Kidron/Wadi Nar is a small basin in which wastewater from eastern Jerusalem flows through the desert to the Dead Sea. Various options for managing these wastewater flows were analyzed ex ante on the basis of both a cost benefit and a multi-criteria analysis. The paper finds that due to economies of scale, a pure basin approach is not desirable from a physical and economic perspective. Furthermore, in terms of political feasibility, it seems that the option which prompts the fewest objections from influential stakeholder groups in the two entities under the current asymmetrical political setting is not a basin solution either, but a two plant solution based on an outsourcing arrangement. These findings imply that the river basin management approach can not be considered the best management approach for the arid transboundary case at hand, and hence is not unequivocally universally applicable.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,45,5,,1112,1126,,10.1007/s00267-010-9486-2,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:000277771400018

We related year-to-year variation of macroinvertebrate communities to long-term (59 y) information on precipitation and temperature. Our goals were to: 1) determine the stability of macroinvertebrate communities in the stream, 2) establish the influence of physicochemical disturbance on community stability, 3) assess the influence of climate change on the macroinvertebrate communities, and 4) assess the interactive effects of climate change and disturbance level on macroinvertebrate communities. Community structure varied naturally from year to year, but changes in taxon richness and evenness were much stronger and more unpredictable in disturbed than in other sites. In the long term, the more diverse (reference) and the poorest (disturbed) communities were stable, whereas communities affected by mild disturbance slowly decreased in taxon richness (slope = -0.07, r(2) = 0.38). This decrease could be a response to the continuous stress or to climate change. The multivariate patterns over time of invertebrate communities at mildly disturbed sites were the only patterns significantly correlated with climatic patterns. In the past 59 y in this Mediterranean area (southeastern Europe), winter temperature has increased 1 degrees C and precipitation has decreased 1.5 mm/d. Marked changes in community composition (70-80% Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) occurred only in years of extremely low precipitation or temperature. In years of climatic extremes and at chemically disturbed sites, Orthocladiinae and Simuliidae became dominant. In this stream, a shift in community equity occurs before species elimination. This shift might be useful as an early warning for biodiversity loss because of disturbance or climate change.

We quantified the incremental explanatory power of multiple landscape factors in native, introduced, and overall local species richness using regression analysis. First, we related variation in local species richness across river basins to regional species richness (here, the basin species pool), area and factors of climate and topography. Second, we related within-river basin local species richness to site's climate and topography, and spatial structure derived from Principal Coordinates of Neighbour Matrices approach, after testing for species richness spatial autocorrelation; predicted local richness was mapped.ResultsPatterns of local species richness across river basins were strongly associated with regional species richness for overall, native and introduced species; annual rainfall showed a significant incremental contribution to variation in introduced species richness only. Within river basins, environmental factors were associated with local richness for the three species groups, though their contributions to the total explained variation were inferior to those of spatial factors; rainfall seasonality and stream slope were the most consistent environmental correlates for all species groups, while the influence of spatial factors was most prevalent for native species.Main conclusionsLandscape factors operating among and within river basins seem to play a relevant role in shaping local species richness of both native and introduced species, and may be contingent on basin-specific contexts. Nevertheless, local factors, such as habitat characteristics and biotic interactions and human-induced disturbances may also be at play. Multiscale approaches incorporating a multitude of factors are strongly encouraged to facilitate a deeper understanding of the biodiversity patterns of Mediterranean streams, and to promote more effective conservation and management strategies.",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,16,5,,773,785,,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00678.x,,,,,,1366-9516,,WOS:000280973100007
Invertebrate,2010,"Fillmore, David L.; Lucas, Spencer G.; Simpson, Edward L.","Invertebrate trace fossils in semi-arid to arid braided-ephemeral-river deposits of the Mississippian middle member of the Mauch Chunk Formation, eastern Pennsylvania, USA","The rapid diversification of terrestrial ecosystems was initiated in the Silurian and subsequently continued through the Mississippian. Detailed collecting of the middle member of the Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation in eastern Pennsylvania has yielded a number of important vertebrate and invertebrate trace fossils, indicating the presence of a significant terrestrial biotic diversity during the Early Carboniferous.This report Illustrates the diverse Invertebrate trace fossil assemblage associated with the ephemeral-river systems of the Mauch Chunk. The Mauch Chunk Invertebrate ichnoassemblage consists of backfilled burrows of deposit feeders, both meniscate (Taenidium) and non-meniscate (Planolites) that typically cross-cut bedding; arthropod trackways (Diplichnites, Diplopodichnus, Stiaria, Kouphichnium and Stialla): striated trails (Cruziana) and resting traces (Rusophycus), and surface or shallow subsurface grazing trails or burrows (Gordia) Tetrapod footprints, mostly made by temnospondyl amphibians, are also part of this ichnoassemblage.The Mauch Chunk invertebrate ichnoassemblage corresponds well to the Scoyenia ichnofacies in consisting of simple burrows, trackways, striate and bilobate trails and pits and simple meniscate burrows Typically, trace fossils of the Scoyenia ichnofacies indicate opportunistic behaviors in subaerial environments that are temporarily or periodically inundated. Indeed, the palaeoenvironmental setting of these traces is a semi-arid to possibly and, braided-ephemeral-river system with extensive overbank deposits The invertebrate traces were developed both as infaunal burrows in the tops and within channel sandstones and as surface and grazing traces on in-channel mudstone-draped bedforms and in proximal overbank deposits. The in-channel mudstone-draped bedforms display both vertebrate and Invertebrate trace fossils. The Mauch Chunk invertebrate ichnofossil assemblage resembles other Devonian through Triassic ichnoassemblages from ephemeral fluvial red beds, confirming that the terrestrial invertebrate fauna had already fully colonized fluvial environments by Mississippian time. Furthermore, the development of the Scoyenia ichnoguild in the Mauch Chunk Formation, in the form of abundant traces of deposit feeders of a shallow to intermediate depth infauna (esp Taenidium), is unusually early, when compared to the previously known Palaeozoic record (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved",PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY,292,41671,,222,244,,10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.03.047,,,,,,0031-0182,,WOS:000279489200018
Assessment,2010,"Freni, Gabriele; Mannina, Giorgio; Viviani, Gaspare",Emission standards versus immission standards for assessing the impact of urban drainage on ephemeral receiving water bodies,"In the past, emission standard indicators have been adopted by environmental regulation authorities in order to preserve the quality of a receiving water body. Such indicators are based on the frequency or magnitude of a polluted discharge that may be continuous or intermittent. In order to properly maintain the quality of receiving waters, the Water Framework Directive, following the basic ideas of British Urban Pollution Manual, has been established. The Directive has overtaken the emission-standard concept, substituting it with the stream-standard concept that fixes discharge limits for each polluting substance depending on the self-depurative characteristics of receiving waters. Stream-standard assessment requires the deployment of measurement campaigns that can be very expensive; furthermore, the measurement campaigns are usually not able to provide a link between the receiving water quality and the polluting sources. Therefore, it would be very useful to find a correlation between the quality status of the natural waters and the emission-based indicators. Thus, this study is aimed to finding a possible connection between the receiving water quality indicators drawn by environmental regulation authorities and emission-based indicators while considering both continuous (i.e. from the wastewater treatment plants) and intermittent pollution discharges (mainly from combined sewer overflows). Such research has been carried out by means of long-term analysis adopting a holistic modelling approach. The different parts of the integrated urban drainage system were modelled by a parsimonious integrated model. The analysis was applied to an ephemeral river bounding Bologna (Italy). The study concluded that the correlation between receiving water quality and polluting emissions cannot be generally stated. Nevertheless, specific analyses on polluting emissions were pointed out in the study highlighting cause-effect link between polluting sources and receiving water quality.",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,61,6,,1617,1629,,,,,,,,0273-1223,,WOS:000276181100028
Invertebrate,2010,"Gaudes, Ainhoa; Artigas, Joan; Munoz, Isabel",Species traits and resilience of meiofauna to floods and drought in a Mediterranean stream,"In Mediterranean streams, droughts and floods are mainly seasonal and predictable, occurring twice or three times a year. Under these conditions, multivoltinism and short life-cycles would be favoured, particularly for organisms with low migratory capacity. The meiofaunal community is therefore hypothesised to have species traits adapted to these hydrological perturbations. However, meiofauna have been neglected in many lotic studies. The present study examined the temporal variability of meiofaunal density and biomass over a 2-year period in three reaches of a low-order Mediterranean stream. Relationships between biological traits and hydrological and environmental characteristics were investigated. Resilience of meiofauna to floods was quantified using regression. Small differences in basin drainage resulted in different responses. The abundance and resilience of the meiofauna were higher in the upstream reach than those in the downstream communities. A small, worm-shaped body and active locomotor structures conferred higher resilience in the face of natural hydrological disturbances. Low-order reaches are refugia for functionally important meiofauna that can eventually repopulate downstream reaches.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,11,,1336,1347,,10.1071/MF10044,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000284230400013

The influence of forest structure, flooding regime, soil conditions, and litterfall chemistry (a total of 17 variables) on spatial variability of litter production within the Middle Ebro River floodplain forests (northeastern Spain) was examined by monitoring litterfall in 12 forest plots in 2007. Linear mixed effects (LME) models, using stem density (SD), river distance (RD) (or soil total organic C (TOC)), and soil total P (TP) as independent predictors, explained 51% of the variance in litter production, while an alternative LME model using SD and P use efficiency (P-NUE) explained 40%. In particular, litter increased with SD and TP and decreased with RD, P-NUE, and TOC. Based on these results, P limitation appears to be controlling litter production in a rather dry hydrological regime. We hypothesized that a deficient sediment input at the plot scale (especially in the outer floodplain), with flood quality (overbank flooding, ground-water seepage, ponding) being a greater determinant than quantity (flood duration, water table levels), might ultimately be responsible for the spatial variability observed in litter production.",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE,40,9,,1698,1709,,10.1139/X10-102,,,,,,0045-5067,,WOS:000282479400002

Low flows in rivers are predicted to increase in extent and severity in many areas in the future, yet the consequent impacts of river drying on terrestrial communities via (i) changes to riparian microclimatic conditions and (ii) the identity and abundance of emerging aquatic insects available to riparian predators have not been quantified.2. We investigated the influence of low river flow on a riparian fishing spider, Dolomedes aquaticus, in five New Zealand rivers containing permanently flowing and drying reaches and, in one river, along a longitudinal drying gradient.3. The biomass of aquatic insects, potential prey for D. aquaticus, declined with low river flows while the abundance of potential terrestrial prey remained similar at all sites. In the replicate rivers, and along the longitudinal drying gradient, spider biomass was lower, and size classes were skewed towards more small and fewer large spiders, in drying sites. A desiccation experiment in the laboratory indicated high sensitivity of the spiders, with prey presence increasing spider survival.4. Differences in the spatial distribution, biomass and population size structure of spiders were observed along the longitudinal drying gradient and disappeared within 16 days of the water returning to all sites.5. In total, low river flow affected the biomass of D. aquaticus, as well as their size class structure and spatial distribution. This indicates that low river flows have the potential to affect adjacent terrestrial ecosystems.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,10,,2062,2076,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02462.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000281676200005

The relationship between inter-annual hydrological variability and metal concentration in water and sediments was explored in Mediterranean rivers (Catalonia, NE Spain) affected by low but chronic metal pollution, using monitoring data provided by the Catalan Water Agency (ACA). During the period investigated (2000-2006), metal pollution was characterized by low water concentrations and high concentrations in sediments. The most consistent pattern was observed for sediment cadmium (Cd) concentrations, showing a positive relationship with annual discharge, reaching values of environmental concern (above ecotoxicological benchmarks). A different pattern was observed for Cu, Zn, and As increasing with flow in some sites and decreasing in others. While Cd seems to proceed from diffuse sources being washed by surface runoff, Zn, Pb, and As may proceed from either diffuse or point-sources in the different river sites investigated. The relevance of diffuse metal pollution in the area of study indicates that polluted landfills runoff might be an important source of metals causing repetitive pulses of high metal concentration in the receiving water courses. The experimental results presented demonstrate that metal effects in fluvial biofilms may be accumulative, increasing the toxicity after repetitive pulse exposures. Since draughts and extreme rain events are expected to increase at higher latitudes due to global change, the sources of metal pollution, its final concentration and potential effects on the fluvial ecosystem may also change following the patterns expected for human-impacted Mediterranean rivers.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,657,1,,143,157,,10.1007/s10750-010-0116-z,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000282323300010

Chemical and physical degradation are due to agricultural and industrial practices and domestic wastewaters. Over a three-month period, a study of the low-flow water quality characteristics throughout Medjerda wadi was undertaken. Longitudinal profiles of water quality were constructed using data from fourteen sites. All sewage, agricultural, and industrial inputs were included. Analyzed properties were nutrients (NO(3) (-), NO(2) (-), NH(4) (+), and PO(4) (3-)), Biochemical oxygen demand after five days (BOD(5)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Along Medjerda wadi, all values change because of conditions specific to each sampling station. Nitrate was the most important form of nitrogen-element load (94%). Its concentration reached 34.3 mg L(-1) at OM(4) point, downstream of domestic wastewater discharges. The spatial evolution of the organic pollution index (OPI) shows that the wastewater effluent constitutes the main source of pollution. Indeed, water quality goes from a moderate pollution state at some sampling stations not or slightly affected by wastewaters discharges to a very strong pollution state (OPI of about 1.75) downstream of the domestic effluents inputs of Souk-Ahras city.",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,60,5,,985,992,,10.1007/s12665-009-0237-8,,,,,,1866-6280,,WOS:000276654900008
Biogeochemistry,2010,"Harms, Tamara K.; Grimm, Nancy B.",Influence of the hydrologic regime on resource availability in a semi-arid stream-riparian corridor,"The hydrologic regime of an ecosystem directly affects ecological processes by controlling water availability, but may also have indirect effects by influencing resource availability. To clarify interactions between the hydrologic regime and resource availability, we quantified the timescales over which precipitation and discharge correlated with abundance of dissolved carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the stream riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert river. We hypothesized that the hydrologic regime drives regimes of resource availability during flushing events caused by variation in source areas of run-off generation. We also hypothesized that seasonal droughts may result in accumulation of resources within the catchment. Such accumulations would contribute to high solute concentrations in receiving waters following dry periods. To test these hypotheses, we compiled seasonal datasets over 4-6 years and used regression analyses to determine the temporal extents at which solute concentrations and transformations were correlated with precipitation and stream discharge. Concentrations of most biologically reactive solutes were unrelated to precipitation or discharge, suggesting overlapping influences of myriad biological and transport processes probably operating on event or shorter timescales. Concentration of phosphate [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP)], NO(3)(-) : SRP, and NO(3)(-): NH(4)(+) in the stream were positively correlated with precipitation abundance over weeks and up to 2 months, supporting the flushing hypothesis. Microbial processes in floodplain soils responded to precipitation and discharge, suggesting that biological processes may mediate relationships between hydrology and resource availability. In this large, semi-arid catchment, resource availability is linked to hydrology via hydrologic transport, flowpath characteristics, and biotic processing.

Assessment,2010,"Harwood, J.; Rong Jiang",A Field Study of the Fates of Arsenal and Escort Applied on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee,"Problem statement: The low organic soils of the Cumberland Plateau, as well as the karst geology of the region, may promote increased transport of herbicides outside of application sites. We have studied the fates of imazapyr and metsulfuron-methyl applied to a privately owned tract on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee and compared the field results with herbicide fate predicted by the computer model GLEAMS. Approach: The fate of the two herbicides, applied for pine release at a site on the Cumberland Plateau, was monitored over a sixteen month period. Concentrations in soil water were monitored using vacuum soil lysimeters. Grab samples were taken of water in ephemeral streams draining the clearcut area and of a perennial stream which receives water from the study area. Uncut streamside management zones of about 50 m bordered the streams. The field results were compared with those obtained using the GLEAMS computer model. Results: Concentrations of both herbicides in soil water dropped significantly within the first two months after application, imazapyr to less than 50 mug L -1 and metsulfuron-methyl to less than 3 mug L -1 and decreased more gradually in the following months. The maximum concentrations observed in soil water were 252 mug L -1 (imazapyr) and 13 mug L -1 (metsulfuron-methyl). Except on two dates occurring 5 months after application, the herbicides were not detected in the stream samples. GLEAMS predicted that very little herbicide should have been lost from the site in runoff or erosion sediment. The model predicted greater retention of the herbicides by the soil than was found through the field measurements. Conclusion/Recommendation: The rapid transport of imazapyr and metsulfuron we observed indicates that further study is justified at other locations on the Cumberland Plateau. Streamside management zones effectively prohibited contamination of receiving streams by herbicides at the study site.",American Journal of Environmental Sciences,6,5,,463,9,,10.3844/ajessp.2010.463.469,,,,,,1553-345X,,INSPEC:12677267

Squalius torgalensis, Cyprinidae, is an endemic critically endangered fish species from southwestern Portugal, confined to the intermittent streams of the Mira drainage. Assessment of genetic diversity and population structure levels was conducted through the analysis of both mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and nine nuclear microsatellite markers. Remarkable low levels of genetic diversity for both markers were observed (He < 0.38, pi < 0.001). These results may be related with the restricted distribution range and dispersion patterns of the species together with demographic fluctuations associated with the intermittent features of the river system. Population structure analyses suggest the existence of two incipient divergent populations; one comprising the tributaries located upstream and the other comprising downstream tributaries of the Mira River. Data also supports the occurrence of high gene flow mainly from downstream to upstream, failing to reflect isolation of populations due to seasonal drought. Obtained results should be incorporated in future management plans for the species. These should be centred around the current connection between populations and on the maintenance of suitable habitat patches, not only for reproduction, but also for summer refuges.",CONSERVATION GENETICS,11,5,,1859,1870,,10.1007/s10592-010-0078-8,,,,,,1566-0621,,WOS:000281907000022

Adults made up 34.4% of the population. Modeling with Program MARK indicated that both age class (adult vs. juvenile-hatchling) and season contributed significantly to the probability of capture. The presence of exotic crayfish (Orconectes virilis) and age class were significant contributors to turtle survival, supporting the hypothesis that exotic crayfish are important predators on hatchlings. Population density estimates indicated low density over the range of water Both adults and juveniles made long-distance movements along the dry stream bed between pools of water. Males and females were both likely to make long-distance movements and were sometimes absent from the study site for years at a time. In addition to terrestrial estivation in foresummer drought, turtles apparently hibernated on land in winter when standing water was available. Growth fit a von Bertalanffy model very well. We make the first report of growth rates for hatchling K sonoriense. Growth rates estimated from shell annuli were consistent with similar estimates for older turtles in other studies. Measured growth rates, however, were much higher than annuli-based estimates.

Flooding caused by such events can drastically alter stream geomorphology, but much less is known about how such floods affect aquatic life. A record flood in early January 1997 afforded an opportunity to carry out a case study of benthic invertebrate community responses to this flood in 14 eastern Sierra streams sampled in the summers before and after the event. All sites were exposed to the flood. Study sites included 8 exposed to livestock grazing disturbance (test) and 6 where grazing was absent or minimal (reference). Reference sites had more riffle habitat, coarser substrata (cobbles), and greater relative abundances of many Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) genera, whereas test sites had higher alkalinity, more pool habitats and fine substrata, lower diversity of EPT taxa, and higher densities of chironomid genera and elmid beetles. From 1996 to 1997 (before vs after the flood), the densities of total invertebrates and many taxa increased in most sites, and significantly (10X) more at test than reference sites. At all sites, bank stability and riparian vegetation coverage decreased and roots were exposed on the stream banks. At many sites, fine sediments decreased and average substrate sizes increased. Examination of 1996 to 1997 vectors in nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) space indicated differences in responses at reference vs test sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblages at reference sites changed relatively little, whereas the relative abundances of certain midges and Hydro psyche increased at test sites. Densities of filterers and small gatherers of fine particulate organic matter increased at test sites, and densities of filterers decreased at reference sites. Changes from 1996 to 1997 suggested that the winter rain-on-snow event had little effect in reference streams but increased the densities of small collector invertebrates at disturbed sites where fine sediments were flushed out and particulate organic resources increased. Given the predicted effects of climate change on mountain stream hydrology, these results indicate that benthic invertebrate communities in small pristine streams might be resilient to the effects of large rain-on-snow floods, but that small, mobile collector invertebrates in some degraded streams might increase in response to sediment flushing and increases in particulate organic matter.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,29,4,,1354,1366,,10.1899/09-185.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000283891800014

Landsat TM images dated 1986, 1996, and 2001, along with a SPOT 4 XS image dated 2006 were acquired to monitor the lateral channel movement on the alluvial fan of Wadi Feiran through the last two decades. The lateral channel movements have been initiated by the channel avulsion of the incised channel of the alluvial fan as a result of obstructing the flow by developing a man-made barrier from the accumulated flood debris in the early years of 1990(s). The man-made barrier had evolved into an elevated concrete road of 3.75 m height with two culverts underneath directly south the fan apex by March 2007. These human activities enforced the incised channel to avulse in a new location leaving the original path and the active depositional lobe of the fan abandoned. Under the influence of successive flash flood events through the last twenty years, channel aggradations occurred resulting in channel braiding and channel widening processes in the reaches of the new formed distributary channels. The channel widening processes occurred on the expense of the inactive fan lobes located within and south the reaches of the new distributary channels. Observing the southward lateral growth of the reaches of the new formed distributary channels implies the possibility of forming a new active depositional lobe that could be merged with the abandoned depositional lobe of the fan.

Different multimetric approaches have been successfully developed in different freshwater environments. However, multimetric indices are difficult to apply to Mediterranean rivers basins, characterized by freshwater fish communities very low in species richness and support a high number of endemics with generalist and opportunistic life strategies. Here we follow a site-specific approach to develop an adaptation of the multimetric procedure usually used in Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), resulting in the Index of Community Integrity (ICI). We modeled the presence-absence of 10 native freshwater fish species from the Guadiana River basin using the Assessment of Nearest Neighbor Analyses (ANNA) model, to assess the deviation of the observed and expected community composition at reference condition. ANNA, which is a multi-species model, allowed incorporating in the index some rare species, though not all of them present in the basin. Deviations were transformed into probabilities of belonging to a reference site and species by species measures were then integrated in a final score. The use of presence-absence only data reduces potential errors associated with estimations of species' abundance and its seasonal changes, which is especially important in Mediterranean environments. The ICI was sensitive to both habitat degradation and the degree of dominance of non-native species within the freshwater fish community (or biotic perturbation), which have been traditionally overlooked in IBIs, but was unresponsive to natural sources of variation. Given the site-specific nature and the simplicity of the index that we propose here, we expect it to be applicable to other Mediterranean basins for which predictive models can be produced.

K.",Sources and processes of contaminant loss from an intensively grazed catchment inferred from patterns in discharge and concentration of thirteen analytes using high intensity sampling,"Contaminants in water from intensively grazed catchments have been shown to cause significant environmental impacts. Effective intervention to reduce contaminant loads depends on identifying their sources and processes of mobilisation and transport. In this study, flow (Q) and analyte concentrations (CA) from a 12 ha catchment in north-west Tasmania used for grazing dairy cattle were monitored at a fine temporal scale and used to infer sources and processes of loss. Three groups of analytes identified based on C(A)-Q relationships, which included hysteresis loops, demonstrated that the TP group (TP, DRP, TSS, TN, E. coil and Enterococcus) was transported by surface runoff processes while the behaviour of the NO(3) group (NO(3), TDS, Ca, Mg, Na) was explained by subsurface processes and pathways. The NH(4) group (NH(4), K) was dominated by the addition of large quantities of analyte from grazing. In addition to the C(A)-Q relationships, concentrations of most analytes decreased linearly over each season of runoff. NH(4) and K concentrations decreased exponentially following grazing events while TP concentrations decreased linearly. The study demonstrated the importance of understanding surface water and groundwater interactions and that relationships between runoff events, analyte concentrations and management as revealed by a fine temporal sampling regime may yield significant insights to sources and processes of loss of analytes in surface flow, at a given scale.

River restoration projects require the identification of environmental and pressure gradients that affect the river system under study and the selection of suitable indicators to assess habitat quality before, during and after restoration. We assessed the response of benthic macroinvertebrates, fish, bird and macrophyte assemblages to environmental and pressure gradients from sites situated upstream and downstream of a cofferdam on the River Odelouca, an intermittent Mediterranean river in southwest Portugal. The Odelouca will be permanently dammed in 2010. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of environmental and pressure variables revealed that most variance was explained by environmental factors that clearly separated sites upstream and downstream of the partially built cofferdam. The pressure gradient describing physical impacts to the banks and channel as a result of land use change was less distinct. Redundancy Analysis revealed significant levels of explained variance to species distribution patterns in relation to environmental and pressure variables for all 4 biological assemblages. Partial Redundancy analyses revealed high levels of redundancy for pH between groups and that the avifauna was best associated with pressures acting upon the system. Patterns in invertebrates and fish were associated with descriptors of habitat quality, although fish distribution patterns were affected by reduced connectivity. Procrustean and RELATE (Mantel test) analyses gave broadly similar results and supported these findings.

Fry populations with high settlement densities experienced a 70-80% reduction in population size from density-related mortality during the first fourteen days after peak settlement but thereafter the influence of density-dependent processes on fry was weak. The impact of environmental conditions on fry populations was dependent on fry size and the magnitude of the perturbation, such that flooding effects on fry survival were most severe when fry were small.4. In streams not affected by flooding, the size and density of introduced trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) were the most significant factors determining the abundance of eventual recruits. A field experiment manipulating brown trout access to fry populations revealed that trout as small as 110 mm may be capable of greatly reducing and possibly preventing galaxiid recruitment.5. Overall, the results indicated density-dependent population regulation was only possible at sites with high native fish densities because trout were likely to be suppressing the number of potential recruits at sites with low native fish numbers. Whilst density-dependent processes had a strong effect on fry survival following the period of peak fry abundance, density-independent processes associated with flow and predatory trout influences on fry survival largely determined recruitment variability among galaxiid populations. Focusing conservation efforts on improving habitat to increase fry retention and reducing the impacts of trout on galaxiids would ensure more native fish populations reached their potential abundance.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,9,,1930,1944,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02427.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000280997300010

The objectives of this study were to compare decomposition rates, net N mineralization rates, microbial biomass, and other soil properties along a gradient of sedimentation rates in headwater systems. These factors were measured in 17 plots situated within riparian forests of ephemeral streams at Ft. Benning, GA. The soils were analyzed for texture, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and bulk density, A decline in soil quality was found with increasing sedimentation rates. Soils in plots with the highest sedimentation rates (highly disturbed or HD) exhibited decreased CEC, temperature, and moisture, and increased bulk density, sand content, and pH. The HD plots also had lower nutrient turnover from decomposition, net N mineralization rates, and microbial C and N. Declines in biogeochemical processes corresponded to sedimentation rates associated with HD plots (1.0 cm yr(-1)). Shifts in biological indicators corresponding to annual variations in climate suggest that the stress of sedimentation may be further exacerbated by drought conditions.

L.",Australian waterbirds - time and space travellers in dynamic desert landscapes,"Australia's waterbirds are mostly nomadic, capitalising on highly variable aquatic resources in the arid interior (70% of the continent) for feeding and breeding. Waterbirds, unlike most aquatic organisms, can move between catchments, exploiting habitat wherever it occurs. In Australia, patterns of resource availability for waterbirds are mostly pulsed with peaks of productivity, coinciding with flooding and differing in time and space, affecting individuals, species and functional groups of waterbirds. Australian waterbirds are no different from waterbirds elsewhere, with their behaviour reflecting broad-scale resource availability. They respond to changing patterns of resource distribution, with rapid movements at spatial and temporal scales commensurate with the dynamics of the resource. The most serious conservation threat to waterbirds is a bottleneck in resource availability, leading to population declines, increasingly forced by anthropogenic impacts. River regulation and other threats (e. g. draining) reduce the availability of wetland habitat and decrease the probability of viable resource patches. It is axiomatic that waterbirds need water and such population bottlenecks may occur when the availability of water across the continent is limited. The rehabilitation of regulated rivers with environmental flows and protection of naturally flowing rivers in the arid region are essential for long-term sustainability of Australia's waterbird populations.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,8,,875,884,,10.1071/MF09088,,,,,,1323-1650; 1448-6059,,WOS:000280848200006

During the austral summer, glacial meltwater supports cyanobacterial mat communities in some streams, but they are not ubiquitous. We conducted a nitrate (NO(3)(-)) enrichment tracer injection in Huey Creek to quantify NO(3)(-) loss in a Dry Valley stream where algal mats would not obscure hyporheic microbial processes. Unsteady streamflow led to diel variability in the tracer concentration and in surface/subsurface water and solute exchange. Subsequently, concentrations of NO(3)(-), nitrite (NO(2)(-)), ammonium (NH(4)(+)), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied significantly during the injection, with a net loss of NO(3)(-), NO(2)(-), and DOC, and production of nitrous oxide. These mass changes within a reach were often coincident with high streamflows. Reactivity also coincided with the highest DOC concentrations, suggesting that DOC is the primary limitation to heterotrophic microbial activity in the stream. Together, streamflow and DOC availability create the hot spots and hot moments that dominate NO(3)(-) reactivity and removal in this polar desert ecosystem.

The Koiliaris River Basin is located east of the city of Chania on the island of Crete in Greece. This river basin has a complex hydrogeology that consists of temporary ephemeral rivers (tributaries), high mountainous karstic areas, springs, downstream karstic areas and karstic channel parts. In order to simulate all of these processes, a combination of four models was employed. The four models used in the present study were: (a) a two-part Maillet karstic model, used to determine the spring discharge, (b) a GIS-based Energy Budget Snow Melt model, developed to simulate the snow melt rate and compute the snow melt flow that enters the karstic system of the high mountainous area, A matlab code developed in this work combines the previous two independent models, (c) an empirical karstic channel model, developed to simulate the flow in the downstream karstic part of the Koiliaris River Basin, and (d) the Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) model was used to model the hydrology of the watershed. Besides the karstic model, developed in this work, a significant contribution is that for the computation of the snow melt rate the energy budget considers the topography of the area (using GIS) that is incorporated with seven important parameters: elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, illumination, land use, and radiation. The main steps of this study included calibration, validation and sensitivity analysis of the HSPF model. The simulated results are in a very good agreement with the observed field data.

"Invertebrate, Fish",2010,"Larned, Scott T.; Arscott, David B.; Schmidt, Jochen; Diettrich, Jan C.",A Framework for Analyzing Longitudinal and Temporal Variation in River Flow and Developing Flow-Ecology Relationships1,"We propose a framework for analyzing longitudinal flow variation and exploring its ecological consequences in four steps: (1) generating longitudinally continuous flow estimates; (2) computing indices that describe site-specific and longitudinal flow variation, including intermittence; (3) quantifying and visualizing longitudinal dynamics; (4) developing quantitative relationships between hydrological indices and ecological variables (flow-ecology relationships). We give examples of each step, using data from a New Zealand river and an empirical longitudinal flow model, ELFMOD. ELFMOD uses spot-gauging data and flow or proxy variable time series to estimate flow magnitude and state (flowing or dry) at user-defined intervals along river sections. Analyses of flow-ecology relationships for the New Zealand river indicated that fish and benthic and hyporheic invertebrate communities responded strongly to variation in mean annual flow permanence, flow duration, dry duration, drying frequency, inter-flood duration, and distances to flowing reaches. To put longitudinal flow variation into a broader context and guide future research, we propose a conceptual model that combines elements of two contrasting perspectives: rivers as longitudinal continua, and rivers as patch mosaics. In this conceptual model, hydrologically complex rivers are composed of linear sequences of nested hydrological gradients, which are bordered by hydrogeomorphic discontinuities, and which collectively generate hydrological dynamics at river-section scales.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,46,3,,541,553,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00433.x,,,,,,1093-474X,,WOS:000278522700008
"Invertebrate, Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2010,"Larned, Scott T.; Datry, Thibault; Arscott, David B.; Tockner, Klement",Emerging concepts in temporary-river ecology,"1. Temporary rivers and streams are among the most common and most hydrologically dynamic freshwater ecosystems. The number of temporary rivers and the severity of flow intermittence may be increasing in regions affected by climatic drying trends or water abstraction. Despite their abundance, temporary rivers have been historically neglected by ecologists. A recent increase in temporary-river research needs to be supported by new models that generate hypotheses and stimulate further research. In this article, we present three conceptual models that address spatial and temporal patterns in temporary-river biodiversity and biogeochemistry.2. Temporary rivers are characterised by the repeated onset and cessation of flow, and by complex hydrological dynamics in the longitudinal dimension. Longitudinal dynamics, such as advancing and retreating wetted fronts, hydrological connections and disconnections, and gradients in flow permanence, influence biotic communities and nutrient and organic matter processing.3. The first conceptual model concerns connectivity between habitat patches. Variable connectivity suggests that the metacommunity and metapopulation concepts are applicable in temporary rivers. We predict that aggregations of local communities in the isolated water bodies of temporary rivers function as metacommunities. These metacommunities may become longitudinally nested due to interspecific differences in dispersal and mortality. The metapopulation concept applies to some temporary river species, but not all. In stable metapopulations, rates of local extinction are balanced by recolonisation. However, extinction and recolonisation in many temporary-river species are decoupled by frequent disturbances, and populations of these species are usually expanding or contracting.4. The second conceptual model predicts that large-scale biodiversity varies as a function of aquatic and terrestrial patch dynamics and water-level fluctuations. Habitat mosaics in temporary rivers change in composition and configuration in response to inundation and drying, and these changes elicit a range of biotic responses. In the model, aquatic biodiversity initially increases directly with water level due to increasing abundance of aquatic patches. When most of the channel is inundated and most aquatic patches are connected, further increases in aquatic habitat and connectivity cause aquatic biodiversity to decline due to community homogenisation and reduced habitat diversity. The predicted responses of terrestrial biodiversity to changes in water level are the inverse of aquatic biodiversity responses.5. The third conceptual model represents temporary rivers as longitudinal, punctuated biogeochemical reactors. Advancing fronts carry water, solutes and particulate organic matter downstream; subsequent flow recessions and drying result in deposition of transported material in reserves such as pools and bar tops. Material processing is rapid during inundated periods and slower during dry periods. The efficiency of material processing is predicted to increase with the number of cycles of transport, deposition and processing that occur down the length of a temporary river.6. We end with a call for conservation and resource management that addresses the unique properties of temporary rivers. Primary objectives for effective temporary river management are preservation or restoration of aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics, preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittence, and identification of flow requirements for highly valued species and processes.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,4,,717,738,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02322.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000275676700001
Assessment,2010,"Larsen, Stefano; Sorace, Alberto; Mancini, Laura",Riparian Bird Communities as Indicators of Human Impacts Along Mediterranean Streams,"Riparian areas link aquatic and terrestrial habitats, supporting species-rich bird communities, which integrate both terrestrial and aquatic processes. For this reason, inclusion of riparian birds in stream bioassessment could add to the information currently provided by existing programs that monitor aquatic organisms. To assess if bird community metrics could indicate stream conditions, we sampled breeding birds in the riparian zone of 37 reaches in 5 streams draining watersheds representing a gradient of agricultural intensity in central Italy. As a more direct indicator of water quality, stream macroinvertebrates were also sampled for computation of the Italian Extended Biotic Index (IBE). An anthropogenic index was calculated within 1 km of sampled reaches based on satellite-derived land-use classifications. Predictive models of macroinvertebrate integrity based on land-use and avian metrics were compared using an information-theoretic approach (AIC). We also determined if stream quality related to the detection of riverine species. Apparent bird species diversity and richness peaked at intermediate levels of land-use modification, but increased with IBE values. Water quality did not relate to the detection of riverine species as a guild, but two species, the dipper Cinclus cinclus and the grey wagtail Motacilla cinerea, were only observed in reaches with the highest IBE values. Small-bodied insectivorous birds and arboreal species were detected more often in reaches with better water quality and in less modified landscapes. In contrast, larger and granivorous species were more common in disturbed reaches. According to the information-theoretic approach, the best model for predicting water quality included the anthropogenic index, bird species diversity, and an index summarizing the trophic structure of the bird community. We conclude that, in combination with landscape-level information, the diversity and trophic structure of riparian bird communities could serve as a rapid indicator of stream-dwelling macroinvertebrates and, therefore, degradation of in-stream biotic integrity.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,45,2,,261,273,,10.1007/s00267-009-9419-0,,,,,,0364-152X; 1432-1009,,WOS:000274399400006

In some areas, these effects will include increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall, which could have important implications for biological assessment programs of aquatic ecosystems. We used a consistently collected, 20-y benthic macroinvertebrate data set from 4 sites along 2 small northern California streams to examine potential climate-change effects on aquatic communities. The sites represented unique combinations of stream order and flow intermittency. The North Coast benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for northern California streams was not influenced by temperature extremes (cool and warm) or precipitation extremes (wet and dry). Other common indices and metrics used in biological monitoring studies, such as the ratio of observed to expected taxa (O/E), % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) individuals, and total richness were unaffected by temperature and precipitation variability. For future monitoring of climate-change effects on small streams, we developed a local climate-change indicator that is composed of the presence/absence of 9 macroinvertebrate taxa, identified to genus level. This indicator detected significant differences between years that were grouped based on temperature, precipitation, and a combination of temperature and precipitation. It also detected significant differences between groups in an external data set including 40 reference sites throughout the San Francisco Bay area, a result that suggests this indicator could be used at larger spatial scales in this region. Two biological trait categories found in large, long-lived organisms decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation at the most intermittent site. This result indicates that climate change might selectively affect taxa with certain traits. The robustness of the North Coast B-IBI and other common indices and metrics to temperature and precipitation variability demonstrates their continued applicability for examining water quality under future climate-change scenarios, but suggests that they probably will not be good indicators for detecting climate-change effects. The effects of climate change in mediterranean-climate streams can be monitored effectively within the framework of existing biological assessment programs by using regional indicators based on specific taxa identified to the generic level and information on their species traits.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,29,4,,1424,1440,,10.1899/09-178.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000283891800019

Benthic assemblages in intermittent streams are subject to further constraints through the recurrent dry phase of their habitats (BOULTON & LAKE 1990). As macroinvertebrates are involved in various processes in stream ecosystems (WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996), their distribution patterns may affect ecosystem functions. Decomposition of organic matter is a crucial ecosystem process, recycling nutrients and supporting detrital based food webs. The significance of fragmentation of coarse organic matter by the functional feeding group shredders is well recognized (ANDERSON & SEDELL 1979, WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996, GRACA 2001). The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of shredders in 3 intermittent streams. We hypothesized that shredder diversity and abundance would be highest at sites with (1) a shorter duration of summer drought, and (2) forest riparian vegetation; and that (3) recovery of shredders after summer drought would be slower at sites with longer dry phase.","INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 9",30,,,1342,1344,,,,30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology,"AUG 12-18, 2007",Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol,"Montreal, CANADA",0368-0770,978-3-510-54080-8,WOS:000312418900007

Our main objective was to characterize and quantify the macroinvertebrate shredder assemblages in 3 intermittent open-canopy streams on the island of Oland in the Baltic Sea, Sweden, by estimating secondary production. Estimates of annual shredder secondary production ranged from 0.005 to 13.6 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m(-2) y(-1) among sites. Shredder production and amount of organic matter were positively related, but shredder production was more strongly influenced by the duration of the summer dry period. Production decreased with increase in the length of the summer dry period, but shredder production was still high at sites with long dry phases and was comparable to estimates of shredder production in permanent forested streams, results suggesting that terrestrial organic matter might be an important energy resource in open-canopy streams. Shredder species richness decreased with increase in length of the summer dry phase, and shredder species composition at sites with a long dry period was dominated by drought-tolerant taxa. Our results suggest that ecosystem functions might shift from being sustained by many taxa to being sustained by fewer taxa as stream ecosystems experience moderate droughts of similar length (2-4 mo).",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,29,3,,934,944,,10.1899/09-179.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000280692400012

In this paper, we review the underlying features of existing nonparametric disaggregation methods, identify some of their pros and cons, and propose a disaggregation algorithm that is capable of surmounting some of the shortcomings of the current models. The proposed models hinge on k-nearest neighbor resampling, the accurate adjusting procedure, and a genetic algorithm. The models have been tested and compared to an existing nonparametric disaggregation approach using data of the Colorado River system. It has been shown that the model is capable of (1) reproducing the season-to-season correlations including the correlation between the last season of the previous year and the first season of the current year, (2) minimizing or avoiding the generation of flow patterns across the year that are literally the same as those of the historical records, and (3) minimizing or avoiding the generation of negative flows.

Stable carbon isotope analyses and ecological stoichiometry were used to determine the basal sources in dry season macroinvertebrate food webs in two floodplain river systems of Australia's wet-dry tropics that have contrasting flow regimes. Algae, associated with phytoplankton and biofilm, were the primary food source, potentially contributing >55% organic carbon to the biomass of a wide range of primary and secondary consumers. However, many consumers assimilated other sources in addition to algae, e. g. detritus from local C(3) riparian vegetation. Food webs were characterised by substantial flexibility in the number and types of sources identified as important, which was indicative of generalist feeding strategies. These findings suggest 'dynamic stability' in the food webs, which imparts resilience against natural disturbances like flow regime seasonality and variation in hydrological connectivity.

Assessment,2010,"Lespinas, Franck; Ludwig, Wolfgang; Heussner, Serge",Impact of recent climate change on the hydrology of coastal Mediterranean rivers in Southern France,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the regional impact of recent climate change on the water resources in southern France. We produced spatial reconstructions of the monthly evolutions of temperature, precipitation and water discharge in 15 watersheds of six coastal river basins and examined the major changes based on trend analysis for the last 40 years. In this part of the Mediterranean, the general warming trend was strongly enhanced by changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns, characterized by a northward extension of the subtropical high pressure domain during spring and summer. During these seasons, monthly warming rates could achieve almost twice the mean annual warming rates. Although annual precipitation did not follow clear trends, water discharge significantly decreased in one third of the watersheds and accounted for an estimated 20% reduction of the water resources in this region. This concerns both the highest and lowest watersheds. In the former, the reduction is likely the result of a temperature induced switch of snowfall to rainfall at high altitudes. In the latter, the reduction of discharge seems to come from lower groundwater levels, which may be related to the temperature increase too, but also have other origins. The recent climatic evolution is consistent with most modelling simulations for the future, indicating that the reduction of the water resources will hold on, probably still enhanced by decreases in precipitation.",CLIMATIC CHANGE,99,41732,,425,456,,10.1007/s10584-009-9668-1,,,,,,0165-0009; 1573-1480,,WOS:000275704500005

This article presents the analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in the composition and structure of this community as a function of the seasonality of rains in a drywood tropical region. It was determined that the periods of scant and moderate rains were beneficial to processes of colonization and development of different taxa, as these periods presented the highest values of abundance, richness and diversity (H'). This last concept was related to a continuous flow of low variability, which favored the heterogeneity of habitats, favorable levels of physical and chemical variables, and the availability of higher food supply. During the dry season, the flow ceased and several isolated ponds were formed, habitats and food were lost, physical and chemical conditions were altered, many taxa disappeared and the taxa best adapted to lenitic zones and moist substrates were dominant. The abundant rains brought new hydrologic dynamics, which, though they generated unstable habitats and microhabitats, allowed for the colonization of organisms, mainly those with winged instars, which increased richness and diversity. Despite that disturbances caused by drought and abundant rains caused fluctuations in the habitats' characteristics and in the composition and structure of the community, the ecosystem was stable and resilient with reference to these community attributes.",LIMNETICA,29,2,,195,210,,,,,,,,0213-8409,,WOS:000287287200002

Unglazed ceramic tiles were deployed in June and August to measure periphyton and invertebrate abundance, and leafpack decomposition and primary production were also measured in August. Relationships between stoneroller and crayfish density and the size of consumer effects were evaluated with multiple linear regression models. Average chlorophyll a abundance was greater on exposed than exclusion tiles in August, but not in June. Sediment dry mass, periphyton ash-free dry mass (AFDM), and chironomid densities on tiles did not differ among treatments in either period. Leaf packs decayed faster in exposed than exclusion treatments (k (exposed) = 0.038 +/- A 0.013, k (exclusion) = 0.007 +/- A 0.002), but consumer effects were stronger in some pools than others. Leafpack invertebrate biomass and abundance and tile primary productivity did not differ among treatments.

North-eastern Spain is a hot spot for the introduction of alien fish species, and its native fish fauna is one of the most endangered worldwide. We used an extensive data set from 2002 to 2003 and historical information from the area to characterize fish diversity and establish conservation priorities in river catchments.2. Diversity indices were used to characterize fish diversity at the basin scale. An index of conservation status was applied for each species, which considers the occurrence, abundance and endemicity of each taxon. We used indirect ordination methods to test the relationship among basin features and to identify those variables most correlated with each other. To identify physical, biotic and environmental characteristics that seem to make a basin particularly susceptible to invasion, we performed a step-wise multiple regression to examine the relationship between the number of native, translocated and introduced fish species (including the original native species richness of each basin), and landscape variables.3. Over a period of approximately 50 years, the mean range size of native fish species has decreased by 60%. The greatest decline occurred in Gasterosteus gymnurus, Anguilla anguilla and Salaria fluviatilis, for which species over 75% of the original distribution area has been lost. The species with the highest conservation index were Gasterosteus gymnurus and Salaria fluviatilis.4. Basin area and the catchment type explained 70% of variation in native species richness, whereas the number of dams and basin area accounted for more than 80% of variation in the number of introduced species.5. The original native species richness and the number of introduced species at basin scale were not related, and thus there was no evidence of ""biotic resistance"" to invasion. The restoration of natural hydrologic processes and the development of specific management tools to protect native species, such as the prioritization of areas for fish conservation and the eradication of local populations of exotic species, are required to restore native fish fauna in these catchments.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,55,8,,1734,1746,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02407.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000279734300012
Assessment,2010,"Mannina, Giorgio; Viviani, Gaspare",Water quality modelling for ephemeral rivers: Model development and parameter assessment,"River water quality models can be valuable tools for the assessment and management of receiving water body quality. However, such water quality models require accurate model calibration in order to specify model parameters. Reliable model calibration requires an extensive array of water quality data that are generally rare and resource-intensive, both economically and in terms of human resources, to collect. In the case of small rivers, such data are scarce due to the fact that these rivers are generally considered too insignificant, from a practical and economic viewpoint, to justify the investment of such considerable time and resources. As a consequence, the literature contains very few studies on the water quality modelling for small rivers, and such studies as have been published are fairly limited in scope. In this paper, a simplified river water quality model is presented. The model is an extension of the Streeter-Phelps model and takes into account the physico-chemical and biological processes most relevant to modelling the quality of receiving water bodies (i.e., degradation of dissolved carbonaceous substances, ammonium oxidation, algal uptake and denitrification, dissolved oxygen balance, including depletion by degradation processes and supply by physical reaeration and photosynthetic production). The model has been applied to an Italian case study, the Oreto river (IT), which has been the object of an Italian research project aimed at assessing the river's water quality. For this reason, several monitoring campaigns have been previously carried out in order to collect water quantity and quality data on this river system. In particular, twelve river cross sections were monitored, and both flow and water quality data were collected for each cross section. The results of the calibrated model show satisfactory agreement with the measured data and results reveal important differences between the parameters used to model small rivers as compared to those for large rivers. Additionally, these results appear related to the different roles played by physical-chemical-biological processes in small rivers as compared to larger systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2010,"Marti, Eugenia; Lluis Riera, Joan; Sabater, Francesc",Effects of Wastewater Treatment Plants on Stream Nutrient Dynamics Under Water Scarcity Conditions,"Despite an array of significant technological advances, effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) generate abrupt physical and chemical discontinuities along the fluvial continuum. These discontinuities not only alter the water quality, but also significantly affect fluvial ecosystem structure and function. In particular, WWTP effluents increase nutrient concentrations and introduce toxic substances, including emergent pollutants, to the fluvial ecosystems. There is abundant evidence that these changes affect stream communities. Fewer studies, however, have examined the influence of WWTP inputs on the hydrologic and nutrient availability regimes. Yet, shifts in these regimes can have clear implications for the stream ecosystem function. This knowledge is of critical relevance for stream management as it provides insights on integrative properties of trophic state, energy transfer, and material cycling at the ecosystem level. WWTP effects on fluvial ecosystems are expected to become more exacerbated under water scarcity conditions, which are characteristic of arid and semiarid regions such as the Mediterranean region. Under these conditions, streams receiving point source inputs may turn into islands of permanent flow within a highly intermittent fluvial network. This has implications not only locally at the reach scale but also at the catchment scale. Within this context, both plant operation and fluvial management may be critical to preserve the ecological integrity of these aquatic ecosystems at the same time that a balance is met with societal demand for high quality water resources. This chapter aims to review current knowledge on this topic, with major emphasis on nutrient loads and in-stream nutrient retention, and to discuss its implications within the context of actual and future scenarios of water scarcity conditions.",WATER SCARCITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN: PERSPECTIVES UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE,8,,,173,195,,10.1007/698_2009_33,10.1007/978-3-642-03971-3,,,,,1433-6863,978-3-642-03970-6,WOS:000278068300011

Macroinvertebrate samples were collected in six Italian rivers along a pool-riffle sequence in three seasons following a multihabitat sampling technique. Chironomids were identified as genus/species, other macroinvertebrates as family/genus. The main physico-chemical, hydromorphological and geographical data were collected. Samples were ascribed to five quality classes according to the STAR_ICM index. Based on Chironomid taxa, principal component analysis (PCA) axis 1 represented an organic pollution gradient, axis 2 represented seasonality. Pool and riffle samples were significantly different according to taxa assemblages. Similar results were obtained with PCA based on the whole macrobenthic community. Indicator value (IndVal) analysis facilitated the detection of the Chironomid indicators of high/good quality pools (e. g. Conchapelopia pallidula, Rheopelopia ornata, Epoicocladius ephemerae) and riffles (Tvetenia calvescens, Eukiefferiella gracei). The Berger-Parker dominance index based on Chironomid assemblages in pools was correlated to PCA axis 1 and performed well in discriminating between quality classes. In riffles, no correlations to PCA axes were detected and a wide overlap between quality classes was present. Thus, assessment in the analysed river type may focus on pool mesohabitat as this seems to represent best the ecological gradient of sites.

We studied the potential effects of drought and climate change on the fish assemblage and its trophic ecology in a Mediterranean stream by comparing an intermittent tributary with two more permanent neighbouring reaches. Although the three sites were dominated by the same two fish species, Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) and chub (Squalius laietanus), the intermittent tributary had a lower overall fish density and fewer eel (Anguilla anguilla). The intermittent tributary had macroinvertebrates with lower density, smaller taxa and higher diversity. Fish in the intermittent tributary had significantly lower biomasses in their gut contents (adjusted for fish length) and more negative electivities than those in the permanent reaches, as well as significantly lower taxonomic diversity. These results indicate that there was reduced resource availability in the intermittent tributary, which resulted in significantly lower condition and gonadal weight (adjusted for length) of barbel and chub. The data obtained in this Mediterranean stream support the observation that reduced water flow may affect fish at both individual and assemblage levels.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,657,1,,167,180,,10.1007/s10750-010-0292-x,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000282323300012

It also includes nitrification and denitrification in the shallow perched aquifer. We included a soil moisture threshold for all the considered soil biological processes. The results suggested that all the nitrogen processes were highly influenced by the rain episodes and that soil microbial processes occurred in pulses stimulated by soil moisture increasing after rain. Our simulation highlighted the riparian zone as a possible source of nitrate, especially after the summer drought period, but it can also act as an important sink of nitrate due to denitrification, in particular during the wettest period of the year. The riparian zone was a key element to simulate the catchment nitrate behaviour. The lumped LU4-N model (which does not include the riparian zone) could not be validated, while both the semi-distributed LU4-R-N and SD4-R-N model (which include the riparian zone) gave satisfactory results for the calibration process and acceptable results for the temporal validation process.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,14,2,,223,237,,,,,,,,1027-5606,,WOS:000274994800004
Assessment,2010,"Mencio, Anna; Mas-Pla, Josep","Influence of groundwater exploitation on the ecological status of streams in a Mediterranean system (Selva Basin, NE Spain)","The ecological status of streams depends on an equilibrium between hydrological processes and biological dynamics. Water discharge is the main requisite fora wealthy riparian habitat. Nevertheless, human practices severely affect water availability through stream water derivation and groundwater withdrawal. In this sense, impacts upon aquifer water storage and its effects on base flow generation have a significant effect on stream biology. Consequently, biological indicators will point out poor conditions resulting from such human impacts. In this paper, the effects of groundwater exploitation on stream discharge and surface water quality are evaluated and compared to biological indicators in a Mediterranean catchment.The stream-aquifer relationship is investigated by considering the hydrological context of each river reach, including human pressures, and the hydraulic head in the contiguous alluvial aquifer, where it exists. These data allow us to differentiate distinct types of reaches that are defined according to a ""Stream-Aquifer relationship and chemical Pressure"" (SAP) classification, which is used later on to standardize the different hydrochemical and biological features of the sampling points.Stream water and groundwater hydrochemistry are compared to depict the hydraulic behavior of the sampled watercourses during wet and dry periods. Specific elements are used as tracers of groundwater inputs, wastewater influence, or even stagnant conditions during the dry season. This dataset defines a framework to interpret the biological status of each reach based on the Iberian biological monitoring working party indicator (IBMWP). Affinities between hydrological and hydrochemical conditions with biological indicator values allow the causal effects of groundwater exploitation on stream ecology to be defined.The use of multivariate principal component analysis shows that the dataset variance is distributed according to the SAP classification, and that variable grouping is in agreement with the observed hydrological processes and their effects on biological indicator values.This work provides evidence of the importance of groundwater dynamics on biological indicators in a human-modified environment. When using the SAP classification, biological indicators acquire a broader meaning as they reveal the status of biological processes and the causal references. Such information is relevant for water management assessment within the context of the European Water Framework Directive, as it emphasizes the control of groundwater exploitation as a key parameter in the preservation of stream ecological status and the achievement of the objectives of the directive.

M.",The bioassessment of fish and macroinvertebrates in a Mediterranean-Atlantic climate: Habitat assessment and concordance between contrasting ecological samples,"Human intervention and drought conditions in Mediterranean rivers may necessitate the collection of organisms from a different habitat type to that specified by the original bioassessment protocol; it is therefore critical to understand the consequences of adaptive sampling strategies in these lotic systems. In a survey of 31 streams (2nd-4th order) in northern Portugal we collected separate macroinvertebrate samples from running-water and standing-water habitats and fish samples from a delineated reach, inclusive of all habitat types. In addition to collecting habitat data specific to macroinvertebrates and fish we conducted a generalized River Habitat Survey (RHS) and derived scores designed to report habitat quality and habitat degradation. Ecological data were described in terms of taxonomic structure, functional organization and by biotic indices and interpreted in relation to habitat data, comparing samples within and between sites for concordance. Macroinvertebrates from respective habitats differed in their relationship with habitat variable with running-water samples more strongly related to substrate and water quality and standing-water samples more strongly reflecting habitat characteristics at the reach scale. Running- and standing-water samples from the same-site varied widely, indicating that substituting standing-water for running-water samples in macroinvertebrate-based bioassessment carries a high risk of misclassification. However, a consistent bias in index scores suggests that a habitat-adjusted interpretation of biotic indices could be employed to improve measurement precision. Variation in key parameters of the fish community corresponded to changes in water quality and habitat structure and to reach-scale features recorded by the RHS. Trends between macroinvertebrate and fish measurements indicated common patterns for oxygen/flow sensitive taxa and for trophic organization that were related to similar habitat preferences. Whilst macroinvertebrates demonstrated no relationship with derived scores of habitat quality, the fish-based Index of well-being (Iwb) was strongly related to the Habitat Modification Score. Overall these data indicate how different ecological samples can be used to focus on different aspects of habitat quality and are suggestive of strategies for both the collection and interpretation of ecological data that would improve assessment performance. This study emphasizes the need to adapt assessment methods not only to the species pool but also to the differences in the managed and natural habitat characteristics of these types of Mediterranean streams.

The network measures water level, water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate. Analysis of the hydrologic data suggests the existence of four hydrologic processes that operate in the watershed with distinctive characteristic response times. The response of the flow hydrograph of the upper reservoir of the Karstic system to a precipitation event had a characteristic time of 10 d while the characteristic time of the lower reservoir was 38 d. The flash flood events of Keramianos temporary river (tributary to Koiliaris) had a characteristic response time of 29 h while the diurnal variation of flow had a characteristic response time of 18 h. The diurnal fluctuation of the chemical parameters had a characteristic response time of 8 h for pH, 83 h for DO and 13 h for nitrates while the nitrate flush from the Neogene deposits to the river had a characteristic response time of 2.7 h.

Their constituent biota is expected to have adapted evolutionarily to strong hydrological variability and salinity stress; however, their ecology is not well known. In this study, we quantify the seasonal changes in the structure of the macroinvertebrate community in the Reventn Rambla (south-eastern Spain), a permanent saline spring stream which is included in a drainage system consisting of ephemeral dry channels (so-called ""ramblas""). Seasonal patterns of community structure were studied in two reaches with contrasting environmental regimes using univariate and multivariate statistics. The upstream site showed more stable environmental conditions than the downstream site, and both sites also differed with regard to species richness, and structural and functional group attributes. On a seasonal basis, community dissimilarity was high during periods when both sites were isolated during summer droughts but dissimilarity decreased when both sites were connected through surface flow. Furthermore, the communities tended to show cyclical trajectories in multivariate ordination space. Rather than being related to salinity stress, these patterns seemed to track the hydrological disturbance regime of this rambla system. Spates tended to disrupt communities, while signs of recovery were evident during low-flow periods. Results suggest that salinity fluctuation does not pose a severe abiotic constraint to these adapted macroinvertebrate communities. Their suits of functional properties provide them with the necessary traits to recover quickly from natural disturbance. While human-caused salinization of streams severely impacts communities eventually reducing their recovery potential, our results suggest that communities in natural saline streams may show similar responses to hydrological disturbance as communities from non-saline streams.",AQUATIC ECOLOGY,44,1,,177,193,,10.1007/s10452-009-9251-x,,,,,,1386-2588,,WOS:000274707300017

To overcome some limitations of current modelling approaches, the semi-process-based, spatially semi-distributed modelling framework WASA-SED (Vers. 1) was developed for water and sediment transport in large dryland catchments. The WASA-SED model simulates the runoff and erosion processes at the hillslope scale, the transport and retention processes of suspended and bedload fluxes in the river reaches and the retention and remobilisation processes of sediments in reservoirs. The modelling tool enables the evaluation of management options both for sustainable land-use change scenarios to reduce erosion in the headwater catchments as well as adequate reservoir management options to lessen sedimentation in large reservoirs and reservoir networks.

We used stream consumer exclosures and large outdoor mesocosms to study the impact of macroconsumers (i.e., fish and crayfish) on recovery of intermittent prairie streams after drying. In the stream, macroconsumers altered system recovery trajectory by decreasing algal and macroinvertebrate biomass, primary productivity, and benthic nutrient uptake rates. However, macroconsumer influence was transient, and differences between exclosures and controls disappeared after 35 days. Introducing and removing macroconsumers after 28 days resulted mainly in changes to macroinvertebrates. In mesocosms, a dominant consumer (the grazing minnow Phoxinus erythrogaster) reduced macroinvertebrate biomass but had little effect on algal assemblage structure and ecosystem rates during recovery. The weak effect of P. erythrogaster in mesocosms, in contrast to the strong consumer effect in the natural stream, suggests that both timing and diversity of returning consumers are important to their overall influence on stream recovery patterns. Although we found that consumers significantly altered ecosystem structure and function in a system experiencing rapid changes in abiotic and biotic factors following disturbance, consumer effects diminished over time and trajectories converged to similar states with respect to primary producers, in spite of differences in consumer colonization history. Thus, consumer impacts can be substantial in recovering ecosystems and are likely to be dependent on the disturbance regime and diversity of the consumer community.",ECOLOGY,91,4,,1048,1062,,10.1890/08-2168.1,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000277525300012

In this study, we used genetic analyses to test if populations of H. siltalai in temporary streams are resettled from populations of the same basin or from other basins.

Population genetic analyses of 11 selected reaches (6 temporary and 5 permanent) revealed low genetic diversity and no genetic population structure among and within basins. Overall, H. siltalai appeared to disperse well among basins independent of stream temporality. Permanent reaches from different basins act as a source of the individuals that recolonise temporary reaches after local extinctions, indicating a metapopulation structure at regional scale.

Lack of sound information on and funding for establishing and managing trees in SMZs is hindering wide-scale adoption of this practice. Australian Codes of Forest Practice discourage or prevent harvesting of trees in SMZs of perennial streams. One concern is the potential effect of tree harvesting in SMZs on delivery of sediment to adjacent streams. The aims of this paper were to summarize the literature relevant to this concern and, in one case study in an agricultural context, to determine the effects on turbidity of harvesting a SMZ plantation.Information was sourced from published studies that reported on impacts of tree harvesting inside SMZs. In addition, a study was conducted in Tasmania, Australia, to evaluate the water quality benefits of a SMZ and the effects of tree harvesting in this zone. This case study consisted of a 20-year-old Eucalyptus nitens pulpwood plantation in a SMZ of an intermittent stream that was harvested according to the state Code of Forest Practice. A machinery exclusion zone immediately adjacent to the stream limited machinery traffic. Ground cover and water quality pre- and postharvesting were measured to identify the major sources of sediment in this headwater catchment, and to determine the effect of tree harvesting.Literature indicates that tree harvesting in SMZs is an accepted practice in the USA, New Zealand, and Germany, if conducted carefully, i.e., using best management practices (BMPs). Negative effects of this practice on water quality, in- and near-stream habitat, and biodiversity have been recorded, but these effects were generally minor or transitory. Tree harvesting in the Tasmanian study resulted in minimal mineral soil exposure and increased surface roughness. Postharvesting turbidity levels in streamflow were similar to preharvest levels (< 2.5 nephelometric turbidity units exiting the catchment). Much more significant sources of sediment were a road, a dam that was accessible to cattle, and a cultivated paddock. These sources led to turbidities of c. 300 NTUs in a dam immediately below these points and above the harvested stream reach during a storm in late June 2009. In-stream dams, installed many years earlier to store water for stock and irrigation, acted as very effective sediment traps.The SMZs and other BMPs used in agroforestry landscapes are effective at protecting water quality.

W.","Ecological responses to variable water regimes in arid-zone wetlands: Coongie Lakes, Australia","In dryland rivers, interactions between flow variability and complex geomorphology expose floodplain wetlands to long-term patterns of flooding and drying and highly variable short-term events. We consider whether the abundance and diversity of fish, macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities in wetlands of the Coongie Lakes complex are influenced by long-term water regimes. To relate biological changes to changes in water regime, mean values of assemblage indices were ranked and correlated against ranked frequency of drying (i.e. water retention) in each waterbody. As water-retention time increased, fish species diversity (richness, evenness) and disease incidence rose, and fish species dominance and macroinvertebrate abundance decreased. The more mobile species of fish utilised the habitats and food resources provided by newly flooded waterbodies. We conclude that fish populations utilise wetlands with a variety of water regimes, and reductions in the frequency of inundation will decrease fish diversity with sequential losses of less mobile species.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,8,,832,841,,10.1071/MF09069,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000280848200002

Seven major trophic groups were identified by cluster analysis; however, four food items (filamentous algae, chironomid larvae, Trichoptera larvae and Ephemeroptera nymphs) comprised almost half of the average diet of all species. The influence of species, fish size, spatial effects and temporal effects on food use was investigated using redundancy analysis. Size, time and space accounted for little of the perceived variation. Ontogenetic changes in diet were minor and limited to a few large species. Spatial variation in trophic composition of the fish assemblages reflected the effects of the Burdekin Falls and dam, a major geographic barrier, on species distributions. Little spatial variation in diet was detected after accounting for this biogeographical effect. Temporal variations in flow, although marked, had little effect on variations in fish diet composition due to the low temporal diversity of food resources in physically monotonous sand and gravel channels. Species identity accounted for < 50% of the observed variation in food choice; omnivory and generalism were pronounced. The aquatic food web of the Burdekin River appears simple, supported largely by autochthonous production (filamentous and benthic microalgae, and to some extent, aquatic macrophytes). Allochthonous food resources appear to be unimportant. The generalist feeding strategies, widespread omnivory and absence of pronounced trophic segregation reported here for Burdekin River fishes may be common to variable and intermittent rivers of subtropical and tropical northern Australia with similar fish communities and may be a general feature of rivers of low habitat diversity and characterized by flow regimes that vary greatly both within and between years.",JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,77,3,,731,753,,10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02712.x,,,,,,0022-1112,,WOS:000280643900019

Sam","EXAMINING THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF RESTORING FLOW INTERMITTENCY TO ARTIFICIALLY PERENNIAL LOWLAND STREAMS: PATTERNS AND PREDICTIONS FROM THE BROKEN-BOOSEY CREEK SYSTEM IN NORTHERN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA","The reinstatement of natural flow regimes is a rapidly emerging issue in river restoration worldwide. In northern Victoria, Australia, efforts are presently underway to restore a natural, intermittent flow regime to several streams which have received perennial diversions for both irrigation and stock and domestic water-supplies for over 100 years. A pipeline to deliver water to landholders will significantly reduce transmission losses throughout the system allowing irrigation canals and diversion weirs to be decommissioned. The motivation for flow alteration in this system lies primarily in reducing inefficiencies in water delivery which, in turn, will be used to meet escalating demands on water resources. The ecological impact of the flow regime shift on these streams is likely to be substantial. This study utilized an existing artificial hydrological gradient (from perennial to intermittent) in two creek systems, to explore relationships between flow regime and a range of ecological variables. These data provide a benchmark against which to assess ecological changes once flow has been altered and form the basis for predicting changes that can assist future management decisions. Data collected from 10 sites across a strong hydrological gradient detected clear differences in geomorphology, water quality and biotic assemblages (macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish). By examining the relationship between flow regime and the distribution of biota we identify both the positive and negative outcomes of restoring naturally intermittent flow regimes within artificially perennial lowland streams. The reinstatement of intermittent flow regimes in artificially perennial streams will continue in many parts of the world as water delivery via these systems becomes increasingly uneconomical. While flow restoration may in principle be regarded as a positive step, these findings emphasize the need to consider fully the ecological consequences of restoring historical hydrological regimes to streams within the context of other human induced catchment disturbances.

The objectives of this study were to describe the effect of drying out on the composition of the mayfly taxocene and evaluate the relevance of individual species traits for survival of mayflies to drying out. The mayfly taxocenes of two model localities, one at an intermittent and one at a permanent brook, were investigated in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Compared with the permanent stream, the taxocene of the intermittent stream was short of nine species, foremost rheobionts and high oxygen demand species. To explain further differences between both stream types in survival and recolonisation ability, 15 species traits were evaluated. These included so-called ""ecological traits"" (e.g., habitat and substrate range, density, distribution, current velocity adaptation) and ""biological traits"" connected with life cycle and larval/adult adaptations. Species showing the highest number of advantageous traits (with only exception of Electrogena sp. cf. ujhelyii - species of taxonomically unclear status) were able to successfully survive under the unfavourable conditions of the intermittent brook.

Juvenile growth in L. gibbosus was similar in all three populations, though longevity was slightly greater in the population from the River Guadiana mainstream. Lepomis gibbosus exhibited a long reproductive season, but the duration of season, size at maturity and reproductive effort varied among populations. The life-history differences found demonstrate the importance of species adaptation to local conditions which might favour their invasion success.

Glenn","Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Fish Assemblages Following an Artificially Extended Floodplain Inundation Event, Northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia","Water extraction from dryland rivers is often associated with declines in the health of river and floodplain ecosystems due to reduced flooding frequency and extent of floodplain inundation. Following moderate flooding in early 2008 in the Narran River, Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, 10,423 ML of water was purchased from agricultural water users and delivered to the river to prolong inundation of its terminal lake system to improve the recruitment success of colonial waterbirds that had started breeding in response to the initial flooding. This study examined the spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages in river and floodplain habitats over eight months following flooding to assess the possible ecological benefits of flood extension. Although the abundances of most fish species were greater in river channel habitats, the fish assemblage used floodplain habitats when inundated. Young-of-the-year (4-12 months age) golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and bony bream (Nematalosa erebi) were consistently sampled in floodplain sites when inundated, suggesting that the floodplain provides rearing habitat for these species. Significant differences in the abundances of fish populations between reaches upstream and downstream of a weir in the main river channel indicates that the effectiveness of the environmental water release was limited by restricted connectivity within the broader catchment. Although the seasonal timing of flood extension may have coincided with sub-optimal primary production, the use of the environmental water purchase is likely to have promoted recruitment of fish populations by providing greater access to floodplain nursery habitats, thereby improving the ability to persist during years of little or no flow.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,45,4,,822,833,,10.1007/s00267-010-9432-3,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:000276655100014

Monitoring biological quality of rivers has not a long tradition in some Mediterranean European countries like Spain. Several macroinvertebrate metrics have been recently proposed to assess ecological status in Mediterranean streams, so it is necessary to compare the use of proposed biological quality metrics to select the most appropriate ones.In the present work, two classic richness metrics (total number of families and number of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera families), three indices (IBMWP, IASPT and t-BMWQ) and two multimetric indices, recently proposed to housed in Mediterranean streams (ICM-9 and ICM-11a or IMMi-L), were compared by the analysis of the sensitivity of these metrics to a multiple stressor gradient which reflected the main pressures present in the study area. For this purpose, data from 193 sites sampled in spring (95 reference sites and 98 disturbed sites) belonging to five different Mediterranean stream types present in 35 basins were studied.The results showed that the adjusted regression coefficients (r(2)) for all seven metrics in the exponential regression models were higher than linear ones, thus indicating an exponential relationship between metrics and the environmental alteration. The two studied multimetric indices presented higher regression coefficients (r(2) = 0.590-0.669) than the three indices (r(2) = 0.524-0.574) and the two metrics (r(2) = 0.471-0.525), therefore showing a better response to a stressor gradient in Mediterranean streams. Within the multimetric indices group. ICM-11a showed the highest regression coefficients. Based on the results obtained, we suggest using the ICM-11a, apart from the IBMWP, to assess ecological status in Mediterranean streams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment,2010,"Sandercock, P. J.; Hooke, J. M.",Assessment of vegetation effects on hydraulics and of feedbacks on plant survival and zonation in ephemeral channels,"The interaction of vegetation and flow in channels is important for understanding the influences of forces in channels and effects on erosion, sediment flux and deposition; it has implications for channel habitats, channel instability and restoration schemes. Methods are needed for calculating forces on plants and data are required on thresholds for plant destruction and survival. A simple method of calculating the effect of hydraulics on vegetation and its zonation within ephemeral channels is described. Detailed cross section surveys of channel morphology, vegetation and estimates of Manning's n are input into the software program WinXSPRO to calculate the hydraulics of flows across the channel for a given event or flow level, incorporating subdivision into zones of differing morphology and vegetation across the section. This was applied to a number of cross sections on ephemeral channels in SE Spain and typical roughness values for Mediterranean vegetation types in channels were assessed. The method is demonstrated with reference to two well-documented floods in SE Spain, in September 1997 on the Torrealvilla and in October 2003 along the Salada. These flows led to the mortality of herbs, reed and smaller shrub species. Some damage to larger shrubs and trees occurred, but trees such as Tamarisk (Tamarix canariensis) were shown to withstand high forces. Some grasses were highly resistant to removal and induced sedimentation. Significant erosion was limited to areas with little vegetation covering the channel floor. Further quantification of resistance of vegetation to flows and upper threshold values for removal is continuing by relating calculated hydraulic conditions using the methods outlined to measurements of vegetation responses in events at monitoring sites.

Oxytetracycline mark-recapture methods (MR), marginal incremental analysis (MIA), and comparisons across multiple populations were used to evaluate the utility of two structures for aging redband trout in high desert streams. We assessed periodicity of annulus formation on scale and otolith samples from all age classes of trout residing in two streams, identified the location of the first annulus on otoliths, and compared age estimates and between-reader coefficient of variation on nine additional streams. The use of MIA successfully validated opaque zone periodicity for fish transitioning from age-0 to age-1, and from age 1 to age 2 in two streams. For fish at liberty 13 and 28 months in the same two streams, MR-derived age estimates from whole and sectioned otoliths were 94-100% accurate for fish from 2-9 years old. Scales were only 77% and 38% accurate for fish at liberty 13 and 28 months, respectively. Between-reader coefficient of variation (CV) for scales was high (11.5%), while CV for sectioned otoliths using whole otoliths as corroboratory structures averaged 2.3%. Scales were thus, an unacceptable aging structure for desert redband trout.

Successful environmental flow prescriptions require an accurate understanding of the linkages among flow events, geomorphic processes and biotic responses. We describe models and results from experimental flow releases associated with an environmental flow program on the Bill Williams River (BWR), Arizona, in arid to semiarid western U. S. A.2. Two general approaches for improving knowledge and predictions of ecological responses to environmental flows are: ( 1) coupling physical system models to ecological responses and ( 2) clarifying empirical relationships between flow and ecological responses through implementation and monitoring of experimental flow releases.3. We modelled the BWR physical system using: ( 1) a reservoir operations model to simulate reservoir releases and reservoir water levels and estimate flow through the river system under a range of scenarios, ( 2) one- and two-dimensional river hydraulics models to estimate stage-discharge relationships at the whole-river and local scales, respectively, and ( 3) a groundwater model to estimate surface-and groundwater interactions in a large, alluvial valley on the BWR where surface flow is frequently absent.4. An example of a coupled, hydrology-ecology model is the Ecosystems Function Model, which we used to link a one-dimensional hydraulic model with riparian tree seedling establishment requirements to produce spatially explicit predictions of seedling recruitment locations in a Geographic Information System. We also quantified the effects of small experimental floods on the differential mortality of native and exotic riparian trees, on beaver dam integrity and distribution, and on the dynamics of differentially flow-adapted benthic macroinvertebrate groups.5. Results of model applications and experimental flow releases are contributing to adaptive flow management on the BWR and to the development of regional environmental flow standards.

Geology and land use are significant drivers of water quality during flow periods while during periods of no-flow, local-scale factors such as evaporation, groundwater influence and the concentration and precipitation of compounds are important. This study explored the water quality changes in two Australian dryland rivers, the Cooper Creek (Lake Eyre Basin) and the Warrego River (Murray-Darling Basin), across different hydrological phases over several years. Water quality varied both spatially and temporally; the greatest spatial variability occurred during the no-flow phase, with temporal changes driven by flow. Concentrations of major anions and cations also varied spatially and temporally, with an overall cation dominance of calcium and magnesium and an anion dominance of bicarbonate. This bicarbonate dominance contrasts with previous data from inland lentic systems where sodium chloride was found to dominate. Such extreme spatial and temporal variability hampers successful derivation of water quality guidelines for these variable rivers and suggests such guidelines would need to be developed with respect to 'flow phase'.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,8,,864,874,,10.1071/MF09289,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000280848200005

Here, we describe the genetic structure of the species and infer its demographic history from six nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Genetic diversity was low (microsatellite H-e < 0.45; mtDNA pi < 0.0015), and both markers resolved two groups: one from the northern Mira drainage and one from the Arade and Bensafrim drainages. The relatively low differentiation between these groups (0.09 < F-ST < 0.29; 0.31 < (ST) < 0.57) suggests past headwater captures and/or that populations were large until recently. The genetic diversity and differentiation estimates were compared with those for other three endangered cyprinids inhabiting similar intermittent rivers. Microsatellite data indicate a population decrease in the last 100-2400 years, probably as a result of anthropogenic disturbance. Human activities together with an intermittent flow of these rivers apparently led to local extinctions with consequent fragmentation and contraction in range. We recognize two management units corresponding to the two genetic groups identified. To maintain/increase genetic diversity, we recommend habitat restoration actions and measures to increase gene flow within and/or between the two units, under controlled reproductive programmes.

Such changes would likely have important ecological consequences, particularly for stream and riparian ecosystems already subject to frequent hydrologic disturbance. This study assessed the potential response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to interannual variation in hydrology in a spatially intermittent desert stream (Sycamore Creek, AZ). We compiled data on the recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following spring floods, with successional sequences captured 11 times over a 16-year period (1983-1999). This period encompassed a transition from perennial to intermittent flow in this system, and included a record drought in 1989-1990. Results show that while the size of floods initiating sequences had little explanatory power, changes in macroinvertebrate community structure during postflood succession were closely associated with antecedent flooding and drought. Year-to-year differences in benthic communities integrated taxon-specific responses to antecedent disturbance, including differential resistance to channel drying, use of hyporheic refugia, and variable rates of recovery once stream flow resumed. The long-term consequences of drying on community structure were only evident during later stages of postflood succession, illustrating an interaction between flood and drought recovery processes in this system.

These pioneer, obligate phreatophytes have declined on some rivers, raising conservation concerns and stimulating restoration plantings, but have increased on others. Understanding patterns and causes of forest change is essential for formulating conservation, restoration and management plans. Our goal was to assess spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation change on the Upper San Pedro River in semiarid Arizona, USA, one of the few undammed rivers in the region. Over 100 years ago, intense floods initiated channel incision and substantially altered hydrogeomorphology. Pioneer trees began to establish in the widening post-entrenchment zone as the surfaces began to stabilize. Using a time-series of aerial photographs (1955-2003) we quantified recent change in area of riparian cover types. Analysis indicated that wooded area in the post-entrenchment zone nearly tripled from 1955 to 2003, at the expense of bare ground, and the active channel narrowed appreciably. This forest expansion represents a long-term response to river entrenchment, with the temporal pattern influenced by recent flood cycles and biogeomorphic feedbacks. Populus-Salix have established episodically during the infrequent years with high winter flood runoff, sequentially filling available recruitment space. Older cohorts cover wide swaths of the floodplain while young trees form narrow bands lining the channel. Barring extreme flooding, the pioneer forests are expected to senesce over the coming century. An additional factor that has shaped the pattern of post-entrenchment forest expansion is anthropogenic water withdrawal. Populus-Salix forest increase has been greatest within a conservation area, where stream flows are largely perennial. In drier, agricultural sectors, Populus-Salix have declined while the more deeply-rooted Tamarix has increased. Overall, the study reveals that long-term fluctuations in pioneer forest area and age Structure are common on dryland rivers, and shows how past events Such as extreme floods can interact with recent environmental practices such as freshwater withdrawal to influence riparian forest patterns. This underscores the necessity of a long-term perspective for forest conservation and management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Results showed low levels of genetic (F(ST)) differentiation between collections in a 6.5-km transect along the stream, and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance matrices, indicating a weak population structure associated with spatial distribution. Our data also indicated that geographical proximity of related individuals in the youngest (0+, 1+) cohorts probably was associated with limited dispersal of younger brown trout from spawning redds. Family relationships provided evidence, however, for movement of adult trout over distances of a few kilometres that probably contributed to the low observed differentiation. Dispersal of adult Mediterranean trout contrasts with the clustering of related older trout observed for some north European rivers and could be related to the reduced productivity in southern stream basins.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,61,6,,672,681,,10.1071/MF09098,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000279106700005

J.; Little, S.; Stubbington, R.",Is the hyporheic zone a refugium for aquatic macroinvertebrates during severe low flow conditions?,"The potential role of the hyporheic zone as a refugium for stream invertebrates during hydrological perturbations was acknowledged more than five decades ago. However, field evidence to support the hyporheic refuge hypothesis during periods of flow recession and severe low flow remains equivocal. Some studies report fauna using the hyporheic zone during periods of flow cessation whilst others have recorded little or no refuge use due to limited habitat availability or harsh abiotic conditions. We assessed aquatic macroinvertebrate community changes associated with severe low flow conditions during a severe supra-seasonal drought on the Little Stour River (UK). Paired benthic and hyporheic samples were collected from four sites (two perennial, two intermittent) on the upper reaches of the river. The number of benthic taxa and the proportion of benthos (particularly the amphipod Gammarus pulex) within the hyporheic zone relative to those in the benthic samples increased significantly during the latter stages of the drought at all sites. These changes coincided with elevated benthic and hyporheic water temperatures rather than a reduction in river discharge alone. The abundance of obligate hypogean macroinvertebrates also increased during the latter stages of the event, suggesting that hypogean taxa may also utilise the shallow hyporheic zone during adverse environmental conditions. Our results, based on paired surface-hyporheic field samples at multiple sites, support the hyporheic refuge hypothesis within a temperate groundwater-dominated stream during severe drought. The results also clearly demonstrate the importance of considering surface-subsurface linkages when assessing responses to disturbance in streams.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,176,4,,377,390,,10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0377,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000281759300008
Fish,2010,"Woodford, Darragh J.; McIntosh, Angus R.",Evidence of source-sink metapopulations in a vulnerable native galaxiid fish driven by introduced trout,"Introduced predators with patchy distributions can create demographic sinks within native prey populations. Such invasions may give rise to source-sink metapopulations if there are still sources of native species colonists in the landscape. In New Zealand, introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhychus mykiss) are linked with declines in native non-diadromous galaxiids but co-occur with these galaxiids in some locations. We investigated whether trout create sinks in Galaxias vulgaris populations, and whether trout-free reaches could act as sources, allowing persistence in the sink habitat. We conducted quantitative seasonal monitoring of G. vulgaris population structure across two subcatchments of the Waimakariri River, South Island. Two trout-free and seven trout-invaded sites in the Porter River catchment and two trout-free and five trout-invaded sites in the Broken River catchment were monitored over two winters and the adjoining summer. Spatially continuous monitoring of young-of-the-year (YOY) galaxiid distributions and apparent survival across the Broken River catchment was also undertaken. Galaxias vulgaris YOY recruitment was high in trout-free reaches, indicating positive population growth. Galaxias vulgaris was absent from three trout-invaded sites, and the remaining invaded sites had significantly depleted juvenile recruitment. Information-theoretic model selection indicated that trout, rather than habitat, drove recruitment failure. Trout-invaded sites could be divided into ""sinks'' that retained no YOY galaxiids, indicating no local recruitment, and ""pseudosinks,'' which had very few recruits. Absence of small G. vulgaris at sink sites suggested population maintenance through immigration of adults from sources, whereas pseudosink sites appear capable of self-recruitment at low carrying capacities. Trout-free reaches appear to act as sources in a river network but are susceptible to future invasions by trout. Thus, not only may invasive species cause source -sink metapopulations in native species, but also the potential of refugia for natives (sources) to become future sinks highlights the vulnerability of these metapopulations when invasive predators are the principal demographic driver.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,20,4,,967,977,,10.1890/08-1909.1,,,,,,1051-0761; 1939-5582,,WOS:000278865200006

When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems, hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic, hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were actively used, as indicated by an increase in beta-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C), since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered, suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30% of the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects, as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after droughts.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,657,1,,217,232,,10.1007/s10750-010-0193-z,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000282323300015

Microbial degradation and transformation of organic matter (OM) in riverbed sediment are key processes with regard to carbon and nutrient fluxes. In this study, we describe structural and functional changes of benthic microbial communities in a riverine environment subject to hydrological fluctuation. Sampling was carried out in the outlet section of the Mulargia River (Sardinia, Italy) under various water regimes, including one flood event. Overall, sediments were characterized by low bacterial cell abundance (range 0.6-1.8 x 10(9) cell g(-1)) as a consequence of their low nutrient and OM concentrations. No major differences were found in the community composition. Alpha-Proteobacteria dominated during the whole year (range 21-30%) followed by Beta-Proteobacteria, Gamma-Proteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria which always contributed < 18%. Planctomycetes and Firmicutes were found in smaller amounts (< 7%). In spring, when the highest total organic carbon content was also detected (0.42% w/w), both bacterial abundance and C production (BCP, 170 nmol C h(-1) g(-1)) reached relatively high values. During the flood event, an increase in BCP and the highest values of community respiration (CR, 74 nmol C h(-1) g(-1)) were observed. Moreover, most of the extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) changed significantly during the flood. The variation of the water flow itself can explain part of these changes and other factors also come into play. The presence of different patterns of functional parameters could suggest that the quality of the OM could be the major driving force in nutrient flux.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,657,1,,37,51,,10.1007/s10750-010-0199-6,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000282323300004

We compared bacterial community structure (using automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis, ARISA), pigment composition and nitrogen fixation rates in benthic microbial mats from stone surfaces collected from 6 sites along a desert stream in the Sultanate of Oman before and 2 wk after an intense flood. Flooding caused partial flushing out of old mats, and new mats re-established on the surfaces of rocks. Visually, the filamentous green algae Spirogyra spp. in creased in abundance in the water column at most sites after the flood, and direct microscopy revealed that the newly developed mats were dominated by the heterocystous Calothrix spp. Multivariate analyses of ARISA profiles revealed that, in each mat, the structure of the bacterial community was different after the flood (analysis of similarities [ANOSIM], R = 0.49, p < 0.001), and pairwise comparison of the presence/absence of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed that only between 18 and 26% shared OTUs. The OTU richness in the newly developed microbial communities decreased in 6 mats after the flood, but remained similar or slightly increased in the other 6 mats. Out of the 9 detected pigments, chlorophyll a, scytonemin, fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and beta-carotene showed site-specific changes with flooding. The average acetylene reduction rates increased after the flood at all sites; however, this increase was statistically significant at only 2 sites due to the high variance among samples. In conclusion, flooding resulted in the replacement of over 74% of the microbial communities within mats, while nitrogen fixation rates remained stable or increased.",AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,63,3,,245,254,,10.3354/ame01499,,,,,,0948-3055,,WOS:000291057400004

The model was extended for snowfall in order to cope with such extreme events. Although the best performance of the IHACRES model on a daily basis is poor, the performance on storm events scale showed a good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow. Apart from model parameter values, the principal reasons for IHACRES model success in this region are thought to be based on antecedent soil moisture conditions, rainfall duration and rainfall intensity before and during each storm.

In rivers with altered flow regimes, understanding fish assemblage responses to flow and physico-chemical conditions is important in setting priorities for environmental flow allocations and other river management strategies. To this end we examined fish assemblage patterns across a simple gradient of flow regulation in the upper Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. We found clear separation of three fish assemblage groups that were spatially differentiated in November 2002, at the end of the winter dry season. Fish assemblage patterns were concordant with differences in water chemistry, but not with the geomorphological attributes of channel and floodplain waterholes. After the summer-flow period, when all in-channel river sites received flow, some floodplain sites were lost to drying and one increased in volume, fish assemblages were less clearly differentiated. The fish assemblages of river sites did not increase in richness or abundance in response to channel flow and the associated potential for increased fish recruitment and movement associated with flow connectivity. Instead, the more regulated river's fish assemblages appeared to be under stress, most likely from historical flow regulation. These findings have clear implications for the management of hydrological regimes and the provision of environmental flows in regulated rivers of the upper Murray-Darling Basin.

Freshwater fish have been particularly affected by these changes and climate change will place further stress on them. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia, represents a highly affected aquatic system with dramatically modified flow regimes. This has impaired the health of its rivers, and potentially limited the adaptive capacity of its biota to respond to a changing climate. Here, we present our predictions of the potential impacts of climate change on 18 native fish species across their distributional ranges against the back-drop of past and continuing water-resource development (WRD). Because most of these species are found across a wide range of geographical and hydrological settings, we classified the MDB into 10 regions to account for likely variation in climate-change effects, on the basis of latitude, elevation and WRD. Cold water-tolerant species will be under greater stress than are warm water-tolerant species. In some regions, the negative impacts on exotic fish such as trout are likely to improve current conditions for native species. Because the impacts of climate change on any given species are likely to vary from region to region, regional fish assemblages will also be differentially affected. The most affected region is likely to occur in the highly disturbed Lower Murray River region, whereas the dryland rivers that are less affected in the northern MDB are likely to remain largely unchanged. Although climate change is a current and future threat to the MDB fish fauna, the continued over-regulation of water resources will place as much, if not more, stress on the remnant fish species.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,62,9,,1099,1114,,10.1071/MF11059,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000295083900009

The aim of this study was to develop a classification for 390 stream sections of the Segura River Basin based on 73 hydrological indices that characterize their natural flow regimes. The hydrological indices were calculated with 25 years of natural monthly flows (1980/81-2005/06) derived from a rainfall-runoff model developed by the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Public Works. These indices included, at a monthly or annual basis, measures of duration of droughts and central tendency and dispersion of flow magnitude (average, low and high flow conditions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated high redundancy among most hydrological indices, as well as two gradients: flow magnitude for mainstream rivers and temporal variability for tributary streams. A classification with eight flow-regime classes was chosen as the most easily interpretable in the Segura River Basin, which was supported by ANOSIM analyses. These classes can be simplified in 4 broader groups, with different seasonal discharge pattern: large rivers, perennial stable streams, perennial seasonal streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams. They showed a high degree of spatial cohesion, following a gradient associated with climatic aridity from NW to SE, and were well defined in terms of the fundamental variables in Mediterranean streams: magnitude and temporal variability of flows. Therefore, this classification is a fundamental tool to support water management and planning in the Segura River Basin.

The methodology is applied to the Buffels River, at 9000 km(2) the largest ephemeral river in Namaqualand (NW South Africa), a region with scarce stream flow records limiting research investigating hydrological response to global change. Daily discharge and annual flood series (1965-2006) were estimated from a distributed rainfall-runoff hydrological model (TETIS) using rainfall gauge records located within the catchment. The model was calibrated and validated with data collected during a two year monitoring programme (2005-2006) at two stream flow stations, one each in the upper and lower reaches of the catchment. In addition to the modelled flow records, non-systematic flood data were reconstructed using both sedimentary and documentary evidence. The palaeoflood record identified at least 25 large floods during the last 700 yr; with the largest floods reaching a minimum discharge of 255 m(3) s(-1) (450 yr return period) in the upper basin, and 510 m(3) s(-1) (100 yr return period) in the lower catchment. Since AD 1925, the flood hydrology of the Buffets River has been characterised by a decrease in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods, with palaeoflood discharges (period 1500-1921) five times greater than the largest modelled floods during the period 1965-2006. Large floods generated the highest hydrograph volumes, however their contribution to aquifer recharge is limited as this depends on other factors such as flood duration and storage capacity of the unsaturated zone prior to the flood. Floods having average return intervals of 5-10 yr (120-140 m(3) s(-1)) and flowing for 12 days are able to fully saturate the Spektakel aquifer in the lower Buffets River basin.

Ephemeral stream-channel recharge through autogenic and allogenic processes, the predominant recharge mechanism during wetter periods, was limited to two low-volume events. From visual observations, it appeared that recharge from channel infiltration was equal to or less than recharge from overhead infiltration.

However, many of these enhancement projects often fail to create expected habitat conditions, because they are rarely planned and executed with inputs from the species' habitat requirements throughout their life histories, and it is frequently assumed that the implementation of a specific instream structure for habitat improvement will always benefit all species present. Using a 2D hydraulic model, the present study evaluates the potential habitat improvement for two critically endangered fish species-the Southwestern arched-mouth nase Iberochondrostoma almacai and the Arade chub Squalius aradensis-resulting from simulating the introduction of different instream structures (islands, lateral bays, and deflectors) in a modified Mediterranean river reach. The introduction of islands in the river channel was found to be the best improvement measure for YOY and juvenile nase and chub, as shown by increases in the mean annual Weighted Usable Area (WUA) of more than 100 and 50%, respectively, compared to the present conditions. On the other hand, the simulation with current deflectors proved to be the worst scenario, particularly for nase, with mean annual WUA decreasing by 3.6, 17.8 and 22.7% for YOY, juveniles and adults, respectively.

Invertebrate,2011,"Bogan, Michael T.; Lytle, David A.",Severe drought drives novel community trajectories in desert stream pools,"1. Ecological communities can be relatively stable for long periods of time, and then, often as a result of disturbance, transition rapidly to a novel state. When communities fail to recover to pre-disturbance configurations, they are said to have experienced a regime shift or to be in an alternative stable state.2. In this 8-year study, we quantified the effects of complete water loss and subsequent altered disturbance regime on aquatic insect communities inhabiting a formerly perennial desert stream. We monitored two study pools seasonally for 4 years before and 4 years after the transition from perennial to intermittent flow to evaluate pre-drying community dynamics and post-drying recovery trajectories.3. Mean species richness was not affected by the transition to intermittent flow, though seasonal patterns of richness did change. Sample densities were much higher in post-drying samples.4. The stream pool communities underwent a catastrophic regime shift after transition to intermittent flow, moving to an alternative stable state with novel seasonal trajectories, and did not recover to pre-drying configurations after 4 years. Six invertebrate species were extirpated by the initial drying event, while other species were as much as 40 times more abundant in post-drying samples. In general, large-bodied top predators were extirpated from the system and replaced with high abundances of smaller-bodied mesopredators.5.

In Europe, Tachet et al. (2002) compiled an aquatic macroinvertebrate database for 473 taxa using information on 11 biological traits described by 63 categories. However, less studied regions, at the time of the compilation of the database, such as the mediterranean Basin, can harbour exclusive genera, which were not included in Tachet's database. In a large-scale study across the mediterranean Basin, we found 44 genera that were not included in Tachet's database (NEW genera). Our main aim was to compile trait information for these NEW genera and assess whether these genera had specific traits that could explain their exclusivity to the Mediterranean region. We compared the trait characteristics of NEW genera to those of genera only found in Mediterranean or temperate regions that were included in the Tachet's database (MED and TEM genera, respectively). We found that NEW genera had more mediterranean characteristics than TEM genera and that some trait categories of NEW genera were even more mediterranean-like than the traits of MED genera (e.g., diapause). Therefore, our results suggest that the specific biological traits of these NEW genera allow them to cope successfully and exclusively with the harsh environmental conditions of the mediterranean climate rivers, which could partially explain their absence in Tachet's database. Other explanations, such as the limited dispersal ability of these NEW genera to reach and colonize temperate Europe or the rarity of these NEW genera, should also be considered. We provide biological traits of the NEW genera to be used in future studies on the mediterranean river ecology.",LIMNETICA,30,1,,129,141,,,,,,,,0213-8409,,WOS:000292075400011
Fish,2011,"Booth, David J.; Bond, Nick; Macreadie, Peter",Detecting range shifts among Australian fishes in response to climate change,"One of the most obvious and expected impacts of climate change is a shift in the distributional range of organisms, which could have considerable ecological and economic consequences. Australian waters are hotspots for climate-induced environmental changes; here, we review these potential changes and their apparent and potential implications for freshwater, estuarine and marine fish. Our meta-analysis detected <300 papers globally on 'fish' and 'range shifts', with similar to 7% being from Australia. Of the Australian papers, only one study exhibited definitive evidence of climate-induced range shifts, with most studies focussing instead on future predictions. There was little consensus in the literature regarding the definition of 'range', largely because of populations having distributions that fluctuate regularly. For example, many marine populations have broad dispersal of offspring (causing vagrancy). Similarly, in freshwater and estuarine systems, regular environmental changes (e. g. seasonal, ENSO cycles - not related to climate change) cause expansion and contraction of populations, which confounds efforts to detect range 'shifts'. We found that increases in water temperature, reduced freshwater flows and changes in ocean currents are likely to be the key drivers of climate-induced range shifts in Australian fishes. Although large-scale frequent and rigorous direct surveys of fishes across their entire distributional ranges, especially at range edges, will be essential to detect range shifts of fishes in response to climate change, we suggest careful co-opting of fisheries, museum and other regional databases as a potential, but imperfect alternative.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,62,9,,1027,1042,,10.1071/MF10270,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000295083900005

Although crocodiles were widespread throughout the Sahara until the early 20(th) century, increased aridity combined with human persecution led to local extinction. Knowledge on distribution, occupied habitats, population size and prey availability is scarce in most populations. This study evaluates the status of Saharan crocodiles and provides new data for Mauritania to assist conservation planning.Methodology/Principal Findings: A series of surveys in Mauritania detected crocodile presence in 78 localities dispersed across 10 river basins and most tended to be isolated within river basins. Permanent gueltas and seasonal tamourts were the most common occupied habitats. Crocodile encounters ranged from one to more than 20 individuals, but in most localities less than five crocodiles were observed. Larger numbers were observed after the rainy season and during night sampling. Crocodiles were found dead in between water points along dry river-beds suggesting the occurrence of dispersal.Conclusion/Significance: Research priorities in Chad and Egypt should focus on quantifying population size and pressures exerted on habitats. The present study increased in by 35% the number of known crocodile localities in Mauritania. Gueltas are crucial for the persistence of mountain populations. Oscillations in water availability throughout the year and the small dimensions of gueltas affect biological traits, including activity and body size. Studies are needed to understand adaptation traits of desert populations. Molecular analyses are needed to quantify genetic variability, population sub-structuring and effective population size, and detect the occurrence of gene flow. Monitoring is needed to detect demographical and genetical trends in completely isolated populations. Crocodiles are apparently vulnerable during dispersal events. Awareness campaigns focusing on the vulnerability and relict value of crocodiles should be implemented.

Biogeochemistry,2011,"Bruder, Andreas; Chauvet, Eric; Gessner, Mark O.","Litter diversity, fungal decomposers and litter decomposition under simulated stream intermittency","1. The drying of stream channels resulting from flow interruption is expected to increase as a consequence of climate change. Implications for aquatic organisms and processes are profound. We assessed whether riparian diversity can partially buffer against consequences of drying on fungal decomposers and leaf litter decomposition, an important ecosystem process.2. Our central hypothesis was that during dry periods recalcitrant leaf litter with high water-holding capacity would extend the window of opportunity for microbial activity in less recalcitrant litter when both litter types are mixed, and that this would lead to a positive litter diversity effect on decomposition. To test for such interactive effects, we conducted a diversity experiment in a Mediterranean stream, in which alder and oak litter, and a mixture of both, was subjected to various drying regimes differing in intensity and timing.3. Drying regime affected both fungal decomposers and the decomposition rate of alder litter. Effects were observed both immediately and 3 weeks after stream flow resumed. Small differences in the timing of the dry period influenced both decomposition rate and measures of fungal performance (i.e. biomass and sporulation activity). Litter mixing, in contrast, had no effect on either decomposition or fungal decomposers, although mixing increased moisture retention in alder litter as required for the mechanism hypothesized to lead to a diversity effect.4. Given the contrasting traits of the litter types used in the experiment, our results imply that riparian tree diversity is unlikely to buffer against increased frequencies of stream flow disruption expected in the face of climate change. It appears, however, that the precise timing of dry periods and high-flow events will strongly influence the extent to which stream food webs can exploit the resources supplied by riparian vegetation in the form of leaf litter.",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,25,6,,1269,1277,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01903.x,,,,,,0269-8463,,WOS:000297156500014

We found 17 mollusc species: 14 gastropods (10 native and 4 introduced) and 3 bivalves. We found five distribution patterns: native headwater (Arganiella wolfi, Stagnicola palustris, Unio delphinus, Pisidium casertanum and Pisidium personatum) and mouth (Hydrobia acuta, Peringia ulvae and Myosotella myosotis) sensitive-stenochoric species, intermediate sensitive-widely distributed species (Planorbarius metidjensis and Radix balthica), insensitive-eurychoric species (Ancylus fluviatilis), and erratic-distribution pattern species (Galba truncatula and Planorbis cannot us). The highest biodiversity indices have been found in non-impacted headwaters and, to a lesser extent, in tidal streams. The biodiversity of the middle reaches, with varying degrees of impact by acid mine drainage and high water deficit, was scarce and dominated by introduced species. Over 30% of the variation in native and introduced species richness is explained by environmental gradients related to heterogeneity (instream macrophytes cover and Fhi and Qbr indices) and acid runoffs (pH, conductivity, turbidity and concentration of sulphides). Severely impacted sites have no mollusc species. The conservation status of watercourses is also very remarkably influenced by the heterogeneity and contamination of the environment. Conservation values are higher in water bodies located in protected northern and southern sites in both basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

In this article, I study the relationships between environmental characteristics and distribution and community structure of freshwater molluscs along climatic, hydrological, physicochemical, and heterogeneity gradients in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. Ninety-four sampling points were analysed, in which, in addition to habitat features, the presence/absence and abundance of species were evaluated. The environmental gradients were measured by use of principal-components analysis (PAC), which orders the variables along two gradients: headwaters-mouth gradient (PC1) and water availability (PC2). According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), the main environmental factors related to species distribution and community structure were conductivity, permanency, channel width, turbidity, slope, and distance to the main river axis. The relationship between biodiversity (measured as species richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index), the ratio of the number of introduced species to the total number of species (zoogeographic integrity coefficient), and environmental variables was best explained by a regression model incorporating, basically, the permanence of water in streams as the variable that accounted for most of the variance.

Assessment,2011,"Caruso, Brian S.",Science and policy integration issues for stream and wetland jurisdictional determinations in a semi-arid region of the western U.S.,"In the semi-arid western U.S., rivers and streams are becoming increasingly stressed and degraded, and wetlands lost, due to human development and associated management policies and actions that are generally ineffective for aquatic resources protection and restoration. There is often a significant disconnect between policy and management with science that leads to continued degradation of surface waters. Recent Supreme Court decisions and subsequent U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency guidance regarding determination of jurisdiction as 'waters of the US' that can be protected under Clean Water Act Section 404 (permitting discharge of dredged and fill materials into wetlands and other waters) is an example of this gap. This study identifies and evaluates key science and policy integration issues for stream and wetland jurisdictional determinations (JDs) in a semi-arid region of the western U.S., including much of the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains and Colorado Plateau. Issues discussed include identification and evaluation of navigable waters, hydrologic permanence/flow duration of perennial and intermittent/ephemeral streams, stream order, significant nexus, aggregation of waters and effects, human impacts and changes, resource inventories and tools, and JD outcomes.

Many intermittent/ephemeral and headwater streams may not be jurisdictional if they lack a significant nexus with navigable waters. Streams in semiarid USEPA Region 8 were classified based on hydrologic permanence and stream order using National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Plus and GIS to provide information across broad spatial scales to aid with jurisdictional determinations (JDs). Four classes were developed for profiling across management units and ecoregions. Based on medium-resolution NHDPlus data, intermittent streams comprise > 3/4, and first order streams constitute > 1/2 of the total stream length in Region 8. Mountain states and ecoregions have the largest percentage of perennial first order streams, whereas the Dakotas, plains, and desert ecoregions have the greatest percentages of intermittent first order and intermittent higher order streams. In the Upper Colorado River Basin, > 50% of reaches are intermittent first order, and 9% are perennial first order.

Jesus; Gessner, Mark O.; Lopez, Dalila; Descals, Enrique",Leaf-litter colonisation and breakdown in relation to stream typology: insights from Mediterranean low-order streams,"1. Scant information is available on leaf breakdown in streams of arid and semiarid regions, including the Mediterranean, where environmental heterogeneity can be high and the relationship between stream characteristics and leaf breakdown is poorly known. We tested the hypotheses that differences in leaf breakdown metrics would be substantially higher between mountain and lowland Mediterranean streams than among streams within each subregion and that variability among streams would be substantially higher in the lowlands, because permanent reaches in the semiarid lowland streams are rare and isolated.2. We compared leaf breakdown and associated dynamics of nutrients, fungi and invertebrates in low-order Mediterranean streams draining sub-humid forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and nearby semiarid lowlands of south-eastern Spain. Streams differed between the two subregions mainly in water ion content, temperature and riparian tree cover. We detected higher environmental heterogeneity among streams within the lowlands compared to the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In the lowlands, breakdown coefficients (k) of alder leaves spanned almost the entire range reported for this species from temperate streams, overlapping with less variable breakdown coefficients in the Sierra Nevada.3. The high variability of k values among the lowland sites appeared to be caused primarily by variability in the composition and abundance of a few leaf-consuming invertebrate taxa, particularly the snail Melanopsis praemorsa. Fungal and nutrient dynamics were less variable among sites within each subregion.4. These results indicate that the critical condition for stream functional assessment of well-constrained breakdown rates, or related metrics, could be met at reference sites within homogenous bio-geo-climatic regions such as the Sierra Nevada. By contrast, in heterogeneous areas such as the semiarid lowland streams, natural variability of breakdown rates can greatly exceed the magnitude of effects expected in response to anthropogenic disturbances.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,56,12,,2594,2608,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02686.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000296502000014

The model was sequentially calibrated at sub-catchment scale and validated both at sub-catchment and catchment scales. A procedure for building the data records for the point sources is presented. The results indicate that, while the model produces good results for flow simulation, its performance for sediment transport is less satisfactory.

"Invertebrate, Assessment",2011,"Chester, E. T.; Robson, B. J.","Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonisation by invertebrates in non-perennial streams","1. If resistance traits drive recolonisation after drought, then drought refuges should contribute strongly to assemblage composition within streams. If resilience traits drive recolonisation, macroinvertebrates emerging from refuges may disperse widely, colonising many streams. To determine whether the contribution of drought refuges to macroinvertebrate recolonisation in non-perennial streams was mostly local (within stream) or broader scale (across streams), we measured the association between the composition of invertebrate assemblages in different types of in-stream drought refuge and the assemblage composition of streams when flow resumed.2. We sampled 16 streams of varying hydrological regime on the western side of the Victoria Range in the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia. Drought refuges (perennial pools, dry sediment, damp sediment, seeps, patches of leaf litter, beneath stones) were identified and sampled during autumn. Most taxa were found in perennial pools; few taxa were found aestivating beneath stones or having desiccation-resistant stages in dry sediment. Perennial pools and perennially flowing reaches were the refuges that harboured the greatest diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa.3. Streams were sampled again during spring. Assemblage composition of non-perennial reaches in spring was unrelated to composition in nearby refuges in the previous autumn. In contrast, assemblage composition in perennial reaches during spring was strongly correlated with composition during autumn. Therefore, drought refuges did not directly influence assemblage composition locally within non-perennial streams. Rather, both perennially flowing reaches and perennial pools acted as drought refuges across the broader landscape. Resilience traits are likely to drive recolonisation in these streams.4. Monitoring of drought refuges in a particular stream will therefore not predict species composition when flow resumes. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Consequently, stream networks will need to be managed as entities rather than as single waterways and the focus of drought refuge protection should be on perennial pools and reaches.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,56,10,,2094,2104,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02644.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000295013800013

We performed a field study following a plot sampling survey. The analyses of soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon contents, etc.), total metal and As concentrations and their phytoavailability assessed with EDTA were related to each microenvironment and the corresponding plant species uptake. The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum.

Terrestrial leaf litter input, colonization, and breakdown are also key processes in river ecosystems, but little is known about the effects of alternating immersion and emersion on these processes. We used litterbags to examine breakdown, microbial activity, and colonization of Populus sp. leaves by invertebrates along a natural gradient in immersion and emersion (i.e., submergence and exposure to air) in a temporary river. Rates of leaf litter mass loss, microbial activity and colonization by invertebrates differed among litterbags that were permanently immersed, intermittently immersed and permanently emersed, and breakdown rate coefficients (k) decreased with increasing cumulative emersed duration (the total number of day of emersion during the experiment). In contrast, the frequency of emersed periods had no detectable effects on these variables. k was positively correlated with the density of invertebrate shredders in immersed litterbags, with microbial activity and shredder density in intermittent litterbags, and with microbial activity in emersed litterbags. These correlations suggest that the relative importance of microbial activity on k increases with emersed duration, due to the periodic elimination of aquatic shredders and the scarcity of terrestrial detritivores. The fact that leaf litter breakdown was detectable under permanently emersed conditions indicates that mechanisms other than shredding by invertebrates, such as leaching and photodegradation, are dominant in dry river habitats.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,537,550,,10.1007/s00027-011-0216-5,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000296533400008
Assessment,2011,"Crabit, Armand; Colin, Francois; Moussa, Roger",A soft hydrological monitoring approach for comparing runoff on a network of small poorly gauged catchments,"Catchments in many parts of the world are either ungauged or poorly gauged, and the dominant processes governing their streamflow response are still poorly understood. The analysis of runoff coefficients provides essential insight into catchment response, particularly if both range of catchments and a range of events are compared. This paper investigates how well the hydrological runoff of 11 small, poorly gauged catchments with ephemeral streams (0.1-0.6 km(2)) can be compared using estimated runoff with the associated uncertainty. Data of rainfall and water depth at a catchment's outlet were recorded using automatic logging equipment during 2008-2009. The hydrological regime is intermittent and the annual precipitation ranged between 569 and 727 mm. Discharge was estimated using Manning's equation and channel cross-section measurements. Innovative work has been performed under controlled experimental conditions to estimate Manning's coefficient values for the different cover types observed in studied streams: non-aquatic vegetations (giant reed, bramble and thistle), grass and coarse granular deposits. The results show that estimates derived using roughness coefficients differ from those previously established for larger streams with aquatic vegetation. Catchment runoff was compared at both the event and the annual scale. The results indicate significant variability between the catchment's responses. This variability allows for classification in spite of all the uncertainty associated with runoff estimation. This study highlights the potential of using a network of poorly gauged catch ments. From almost no catchment understanding the proposed methodology allows to compare poorly gauged catchments and highlights similarity/dissimilarity between catchment responses.

M.",Water Flow Dynamics of Groundwater-Fed Streams and Their Ecological Significance in a Glacierized Catchment,"Subsurface flow pathways of groundwater-fed streams were characterized on a floodplain terrace of the Toklat River, Alaska, in summer 2008, to establish the influence of local physicochemical variability upon macroinvertebrate communities. Streams proximal to the valley side (A sites) and to the main meltwater channel (B sites) were studied. Chloride and natural isotopic tracers (delta(18)O and delta(2)H) were used to identify water sources and flow pathways. Results indicated that flow in B sites was dominated by seepage of glacial meltwater through the alluvial aquifer. Streamflow at sites situated at higher elevations was ephemeral, and commenced with the seasonal rise in the groundwater table. In contrast, the physicochemistry of A sites was characteristic of seepage from valley-side debris fans, which maintained perennial flow to streams at lower elevations. Macroinvertebrate diversity was lower in ephemeral streams, likely due to colonization constraints. In June macroinvertebrate abundance was significantly positively correlated with the percentage contribution to streamflow from debris-fan seepage (p < 0.05) and with fine particulate organic matter concentration (FPOM) (p < 0.05); FPOM was correlated with debris fan seepage (p < 0.05). These relationships were not evident in July and August, when organic matter availability increased. Our study demonstrates that flow pathways and organic matter availability significantly influence macroinvertebrate communities in these groundwater-fed streams.",ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH,43,3,,364,379,,10.1657/1938-4246-43.3.364,,,,,,1523-0430,,WOS:000294318500005

These indexes assign a global ecological status of the biotic community, but not necessarily may detect specific effects of water pollutants. Conversely a large set of biochemical markers measured in macroinvertebrate benthic species can detect sublethal effects and inform us about additional environmental factors that are impairing benthic communities. This is especially interesting in moderately polluted sites, where other stressors are already affecting communities but not too strongly to be detected by biotic indexes. Up to ten different markers belonging to distinct metabolic paths and 42 contaminants measured in sample collections of the caddis fly Hydropsyche exocellata were assessed across a polluted gradient in the industrialized Mediterranean River basins of Besos and Llobregat (NE, Spain). Twenty four sample collections were selected to include macroinvertebrate communities representing the five impairment degrees defined by the Spanish Environmental authorities using the biotic metrics. Results evidenced a clear deterioration of the ecological water quality parameters and benthic communities towards downstream reaches. Biochemical responses varied significantly across the studied samples and were able to differentiate samples within communities having a good and deteriorated ecological stage. Principal Component Analyses indicated that salinity was one of the major stresses affecting macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas antioxidant and metabolizing enzymes responded differently and were closely related to high and presumably toxic levels of accumulated organic pollutants. Therefore these results indicate that the use of multiple -markers sensitive to water pollution may provide complementary information to diagnose environmental factors that are impairing macroinvertebrate communities.

Likewise, geoaccumulation indices (Igeos) varied from very highly polluted with Sn and Te, strongly to very strongly polluted with Bi and Se, and moderately polluted with Sb. The polluted sites of Ag, Bi, Sb, Se, Sn and Te were outlined using Igeos maps, and economic sites of Ag and Sn were identified by geochemical maps leading to their sources, which are likely to be mining activities and lithogenic processes.

In temporary rivers, litter breakdown is reduced during dry phases, but the long-term effect of alternating drying and wetting cycles on litter breakdown is still poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that leaf litter breakdown (LLB) in temporary rivers is primarily controlled by flow permanence (the number of flowing days over a given period expressed in %), and that drying events affect LLB during leaf fall periods through reduction of microbial activity and the modification of aquatic invertebrate assemblages. LLB rates (k), microbial activity and invertebrate assemblages were determined in winter at ten cross-sections scattered along a flow permanence gradient on the temporary Albarine River, France. Results demonstrated that summer drying events affected the breakdown process for up to 6 months after flow has resumed in the river. LLB rates decreased exponentially with decreasing flow permanence, and with increasing drying event duration and frequency. These exponential relationships were observed for flow permanence variables calculated for the river for both 24-years and 1-year time periods prior to the experiment. A decrease in flow permanence from 100 to 85% led to a four-fold decrease in leaf litter breakdown rate. Microbial activity, which typically did not differ between cross-sections, failed to explain the between-cross-section differences in k. By contrast, invertebrate assemblages and, shredders, in particular, decreased exponentially with decreasing flow permanence and with increasing drying event duration and frequency.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,471,483,,10.1007/s00027-011-0193-8,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000296533400003

Many pollutants stored in the riverbed during the low-flow period can be transferred to the downstream environments during flood events. The study focused on two processes that affect the fate and the transport of nutrients, a physical process (retention in the riverbed sediments) and a biological process (denitrification). A spatial campaign was carried out during a low-flow period to characterize the nutrient contents of both water and sediments in the VSne River. The results showed high nutrient concentrations in the water column downstream of the treated wastewater disposal (up to 13,315 mu g N/L for ammonium and 2,901 mu g P/L for total phosphorus). Nutrient concentrations decreased rapidly downstream of the disposal whereas nutrient contents in the sediments increased (up to 1,898 and 784 mu g/g for total phosphorus and Kjeldahl nitrogen, respectively). According to an in situ experiment using sediment boxes placed in the riverbed for 85 days, we estimated that the proportion of nutrients trapped in the sediments represents 25% (respectively 10%) of phosphorus (respectively nitrogen) loads lost from the water column. In parallel, laboratory tests indicated that denitrification occurred in the VSne River, and we estimated that denitrification likely coupled to nitrification processes during the 85 days of the experiment was significantly involved in the removal of nitrogen loads (up to 38%) from the water column and was greater than accumulation processes.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,181,41730,,491,507,,10.1007/s10661-010-1844-2,,,,,,0167-6369,,WOS:000294259300037

These characteristics of the streams were assessed over four consecutive years (2003-2006). The main objective of the study was to analyse the spatial and temporal pattern of the physical attributes of the mesohabitats. Classification strength and dendrograms were examined for each stream, mesohabitat type, and combination of stream and mesohabitat type and for stream mesohabitat type and year, whereas Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ordination (NMDS) was used to analyse classification patterns. The Villahermosa and Ebron streams were more homogeneous than the Palancia and Vallanca streams, whereas riffles and glides were more homogeneous than pools and rapids. The NMDS indicated that the slow water-velocity (pools, glides) and fast (riffles, rapids) mesohabitats tended to group together. Temporally, the Ebron stream pools were homogeneous and very stable over the four years, whereas the Vallanca and Villahermosa pools showed a certain degree of variability. The Palancia pools were the most variable and heterogeneous during the study period.

M.; Gomez, R.; Mora-Gomez, J.; Sangiorgio, F.; Gelbrecht, J.; Tockner, K.",Preconditioning effects of intermittent stream flow on leaf litter decomposition,"Autumnal input of leaf litter is a pivotal energy source in most headwater streams. In temporary streams, however, water stress may lead to a seasonal shift in leaf abscission. Leaves accumulate at the surface of the dry streambed or in residual pools and are subject to physicochemical preconditioning before decomposition starts after flow recovery. In this study, we experimentally tested the effect of photodegradation on sunlit streambeds and anaerobic fermentation in anoxic pools on leaf decomposition during the subsequent flowing phase. To mimic field preconditioning, we exposed Populus tremula leaves to UV-VIS irradiation and wet-anoxic conditions in the laboratory. Subsequently, we quantified leaf mass loss of preconditioned leaves and the associated decomposer community in five low-order temporary streams using coarse and fine mesh litter bags. On average, mass loss after approximately 45 days was 4 and 7% lower when leaves were preconditioned by irradiation and anoxic conditions, respectively. We found a lower chemical quality and lower ergosterol content (a proxy for living fungal biomass) in leaves from the anoxic preconditioning, but no effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages were detected for any preconditioning treatment. Overall, results from this study suggest a reduced processing efficiency of organic matter in temporary streams due to preconditioning during intermittence of flow leading to reduced substrate quality and repressed decomposer activity. These preconditioning effects may become more relevant in the future given the expected worldwide increase in the geographical extent of intermittent flow as a consequence of global change.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,599,609,,10.1007/s00027-011-0231-6,,,,,,1015-1621; 1420-9055,,WOS:000296533400012

Four sites spread across the alluvial zone and three sites from the estuarine zone were sampled. TOC concentration in the sediments of the alluvial and estuarine zone sites ranged between 0.04 and 0.39% and 0.04 and 0.23%, respectively. It was observed that grain size differed significantly at the alluvial zone sites, whereas an uniform trend was found in the estuarine zone sites. The study indicated that low concentration of TOC and coarse size fractions (sand) in sediments were well correlated with available records of arid/weaker palaeomonsoon periods, whereas higher concentration of TOC and fine grain size fractions (silt + clay) in sediments were well correlated with available records of enhanced palaeomonsoon periods of the ephemeral Mahi River. Uniform concentrations of TOC and fine grain size particles in sediments at the estuarine zone sites are attributed to the backwater in the system, deeper sedimentation, and/or greater decomposition processes.

In their natural state, river floodplains are composed of a complex mosaic of contrasting aquatic and terrestrial habitats. These habitats are expected to differ widely in their properties and corresponding ecological processes, although empirical data on their capacity to produce, store and transform organic matter and nutrients are limited.2. The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify the spatiotemporal variation of respiration, a dominant carbon flux in ecosystems, in a complex river floodplain, (ii) to identify the environmental drivers of respiration within and among floodplain habitat types and (iii) to calculate whole-floodplain respiration and to put these values into a global ecosystem context.3. We measured soil and sediment respiration (sum of root and heterotrophic respiration; SR) throughout an annual cycle in two aquatic (pond and channel) and four terrestrial (gravel, large wood, vegetated island and riparian forest) floodplain habitat types in the island-braided section of the near-natural Tagliamento River (NE Italy).4. Floodplain habitat types differed greatly in substratum composition (soil to coarse gravel), organic matter content (0.63 to 4.1% ash-free dry mass) and temperature (seasonal range per habitat type: 8.6 to 33.1 degrees C). Average annual SR ranged from 0.54 +/- 1.56 (exposed gravel) to 3.94 +/- 3.72 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) (vegetated islands) indicating distinct variation in respiration within and among habitat types.

We documented longitudinal changes in DOC concentrations and quality (defined as chemical complexity and measured as specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, SUVA) along a 66 km stream dominated by treated wastewater effluent. DOC concentrations along the stream declined by an average of 64%, and chemical complexity increased substantially. We posed four hypotheses to explain changes in downstream water chemistry; including hydrologic dilution, microbial mineralization, abiotic sorption to suspended sediments, and photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Only the second and fourth hypotheses represent permanent removal mechanisms. Our data most strongly supported predictions from the dilution hypothesis and microbial mineralization as an explanation for the changes in DOC chemistry. Surface-subsurface water linkages were important but altered from unmanaged streams, as deep groundwater was used to augment surface flows. Variation in the use of groundwater was linked to human decision making and engineering related to water management. Reduction in geomorphic complexity increased the importance of dilution in explaining patterns but also increased the importance of UV oxidation as a mechanism influencing DOC chemistry. Our findings suggest urban stream management has shifted dependence on microbially mediated C removal mechanisms to hydrologic dilution to reduce output concentrations. This shift lowers contaminant removal potential and increases dependence on limited groundwater resources.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,116,,,,,G02015,10.1029/2010JG001429,,,,,,0148-0227,,WOS:000290933400001

We investigated linkages between groundwater pumping from the High Plains Aquifer and stream fish habitat loss at multiple spatial scales during spring and summer 2005-2007 in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, USA. Monthly low-altitude flights showed that flowing reaches were reduced from about 65 to <= 15 km by late summer, and long permanently dry segments in the lower basin prevent recolonization. Drying occurred rapidly during summer within three 6.4-km river segments, and patterns in habitat connectivity varied among segments owing to hydraulic conductivity. Most refuge pool habitats dried completely or lost more than half their volume, disconnecting from other pools by late summer. On the basis of these empirical habitat data, and historical groundwater and streamflow data, we constructed a MODFLOW model to predict how groundwater pumping will affect water table levels and fish habitat under three future scenarios. Under the most conservative scenario, we predicted that only 57% of refuge pools will remain in 35 years (2045), nearly all isolated in a 1.7-km fragment of river. A water balance model indicated that maintaining current water table levels and refuge pools for fishes would require a 75% reduction in groundwater pumping, which is not economically or politically feasible. Given widespread streamflow declines, ecological futures are bleak for stream fishes in the western Great Plains, and managers will be challenged to conserve native fishes under current groundwater pumping regimes.

Parallel factor analysis of excitation-emission matrices showed that humic-like components derived mainly from terrestrial plant material dominated total DOM fluorescence for all pools. Evaporation models using delta(2)H and delta(18)O showed a variety of pool hydrologic regimes, including pools with moderate to high evaporative water loss that were largely isolated from shallow alluvium water inputs and pools with consistent alluvium water throughflow and low evaporation. Concentrations of C, N, and P as well as total DOM fluorescence were generally greater in pools with high evaporative loss and lower in pools with alluvium water inputs.

This study identified and mapped permanent natural wetlands across the Eastern Lake Eyre Basin in Australia and classified them into four types: riverine waterholes, rockholes, discharge springs and outcrop springs. Waterholes are the most widespread and numerous source of lasting water, while springs and rockholes are confined to relatively discrete clusters. The characteristics of each wetland type are summarised, and their biological values compared by examining various scales of endemism for vascular plant, fish and mollusc species. Discharge springs contain an exceptional concentration of endemic species across all three lifeforms at a range of scales. Waterholes are critical drought refugia for native fish species that also utilise a vast network of ephemeral streams during and after floods. Rockholes and outcrop springs do not contain any known specialised endemics, although the latter have disjunct populations of some plants and fish. The existing knowledge of antiquity, connectivity and habitat differentiation of the wetland types is compiled and their role in determining biological endemism is discussed. Exotic fish are a major conservation issue, the recovery of the discharge springs should be paramount, and the intact network of permanent waterholes should be preserved. A focus on endemism, combined with an understanding of the biogeographical processes underlying the observed patterns provides an effective and systematic approach to setting priorities for regional biodiversity conservation.

However, mid- to long-term monitoring of the physical characteristics of river habitats lacks a standardised methodology. This contrasts with well-established methods for monitoring other river ecosystem components. Some attempts have been made to standardise the methods for characterising river habitats including the European Guidance Standard for Assessing the Hydromorphological Characteristics of Rivers (CEN, 2002) and the Physical and Chemical Assessment Module within the Australian River Assessment System (AusRivAS). One of the first steps toward advancing the development and use of methods for characterising river habitats in mid- to long-term monitoring programs is to review current practices so that deficiencies can be identified and addressed. In the present work, we review more than 50 methods that have been used to characterise river habitats worldwide. This review uses the European standard as a reference benchmark for comparison with existing methods of river habitat characterisation. Methods of characterising river habitats differ mainly with respect to three features: (I) the objectives for which they were designed, (2) the time required for their application and (3) whether they measure characteristics or evaluate them. Channel and riparian zone characteristics are more extensively covered than floodplain characteristics. Moreover, of all the described river habitat characteristics, bank stability, channel substrate, artificial structures, riparian vegetation structure, channel dimensions, flow types or flow status, adjacent land uses and bars are the most commonly recorded. We conclude that assessment methods of river habitat characteristics that gather quantitative information at a range of spatial scales could be the most effective, as they provide relatively extensive data sets that can be used to analyse information for several purposes. Finally, some types of rivers, such as intermittent rivers, require further work in order to identify their physical habitat characteristics and the proper monitoring methodology.",LIMNETICA,30,2,,217,234,,,,,,,,0213-8409,,WOS:000298769700005

"Invertebrate, Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2011,"Fritz, Ken M.; Feminella, Jack W.",Invertebrate colonization of leaves and roots within sediments of intermittent Coastal Plain streams across hydrologic phases,"Ecological flows between habitats are vital for predicting and understanding structure and function of recipient systems. Ecological flows across riparian areas and headwater intermittent streams are likely to be especially important in many river networks because of the shear extent of these interfaces, their high edge-to-width ratio, and the alternation of wet and dry conditions in intermittent channels. While there has been substantial research supporting the importance of riparian-stream linkages above-ground, comparatively less research has investigated below-ground linkages. We tested the hypothesis that riparian roots are colonized by invertebrates as a food source within stream beds of intermittent headwater streams. We compared benthic invertebrate assemblages colonizing three types of buried substrates (leaves, roots, and plastic roots) among three intermittent Coastal Plain streams, each with a different riparian management treatment (clearcut, thinned, and reference), over a I-year period. Invertebrate density was significantly lower in root litterbags than in plastic roots litterbags, but neither differed from densities in leaf litterbags. Total invertebrate abundances, however, were significantly higher in leaf and root litterbags compared to abundances in plastic root litterbags. Invertebrate biomass and richness did not vary among substrates, but invertebrate density, abundance, and richness all declined from the wet phase (September-December) through the dry phase (June-August). Meiofauna and aquatic dipterans were the primary colonizing invertebrates during the wet phase. Relative abundance of terrestrial taxa increased during the dry phase, but their absolute abundance remained lower than aquatic taxa during the wet phase. Invertebrate composition did not differ among substrate types, but was significantly different among streams and time periods. Cumulative number of dry days, degree days, and redox depth all strongly correlated with assemblage structure as indicated by ordination scores. Our results suggest that subsurface invertebrates respond to leaves and roots as food sources, but assemblage composition is not substrate specific. Colonization of leaves and roots within stream beds by aquatic and terrestrial taxa supports the idea that headwater intermittent streams are important interfaces for the reciprocal exchange of energy and materials between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,459,469,,10.1007/s00027-011-0192-9,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000296533400002

Macroinvertebrate sampling was spatially intensive to account for the relative frequency of meso- (i.e., riffles and pools) and micro-habitats (i.e., different mineral and organic-based substrata) at each site. Samples were collected at two distinctly different phases of the hydrograph: (1) during the flowing period, when pool-riffle sequences were well-established, and (2) during the dry phase, when only isolated pools were expected to occur in the temporary streams. During the dry season, both a reduction in the available total habitat and in microhabitat diversity in all sites studied was observed. As a result, taxon richness decreased in all streams, but more dramatically at temporary stream sites and particularly so in the infrequently remaining discontinuous riffles. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed among catchments (i.e., geographical identity) and sites (perennial vs. temporary). Invertebrate differences were also strong within and among meso- and micro-habitats, particularly mineral and organic microhabitat patches, and differences were due to both loss of taxa from some habitats and some taxa exhibiting certain habitat affinities.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,567,579,,10.1007/s00027-011-0218-3,,,,,,1015-1621; 1420-9055,,WOS:000296533400010

Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.",LIMNETICA,30,2,,307,328,,,,,,,,0213-8409,,WOS:000298769700011

Chicken Creek in Germany, an experimentally created watershed in an early successional stage, offers the opportunity to assess the spatiotemporal variation in metabolic activity in a simplified system. We measured microbial respiration in soils and sediments along the hydrologic flow path from upland terrestrial to ephemeral to perennial sites of three stream corridors. Dry soils and sediments were rewetted before respiration measurements to mimic periods of activity during and after rainfall. Respiration rates and organic matter contents of soil and sediment were generally low. The presence of algae and accretion of vascular plant fragments in the perennial stream reaches increased respiration rates, pointing to the importance of particulate organic matter. Contrary to expectation, respiration rates of rewetted soil and sediment from dry stream channels were similar to rates measured with sediments collected in the perennial channel sections. This suggests that permanent water availability was not a main factor determining metabolic potential in the early successional Chicken Creek watershed. Carbon turnover in perennial channels was fourfold to eightfold higher than in ephemeral channels and terrestrial sites, as water was permanently available. However, this magnitude was insufficient for perennial channels to compensate for the large surface area of terrestrial soils: extrapolated to a year and the whole watershed, stream channels contributed only 5% to total carbon turnover, 95% being due to soils during and after rainfall events.",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,116,,,,,G02012,10.1029/2010JG001516,,,,,,0148-0227,,WOS:000290621700002

Assessment,2011,"Hancock, G. R.; Coulthard, T. J.; Willgoose, G. R.",Modeling erosion and channel movement - response to rainfall variability in South East Australia,"Catchments and channel networks continually adjust to fluctuations in stream discharge and sediment load as the fluvial system responds to both extrinsic and intrinsic forcings. External forcings may include climate and tectonics, whereas examples of internal forcings are land cover and land use changes as well as autogenic adjustments within the system itself (Nicholas and Quinne, 2007). While it is well recognised that erosion or channel aggradation is usually associated with increased amount or intensity of precipitation, subtle thresholds may operate where differences in rainfall events and resultant sediment delivery (increase or decrease in stream power) may produce rapid change in erosion rates and patterns. Therefore, apparently similar systems can respond differently under similar conditions (Knighton, 1998).Hillslope erosion or channel aggradation is usually associated with increased amount or intensity of precipitation, yet subtle thresholds may operate where differences in rainfall events and resultant sediment delivery may produce rapid change in erosion rates and patterns. Here a modelling approach, using a landscape evolution model (CAESAR) is used to investigate hillslope erosion and sensitivity of channel position and movement under a series of realistic rainfall scenarios for a low-rainfall catchment (similar to 600mm per annum) with ephemeral streams in South-Eastern Australia.Considerable research has already been undertaken to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic forces on catchment and stream channel change driven by a real need to predict how different systems respond under different forcings (Knighton, 1998). However, this is especially difficult to understand if the changes occur at different thresholds and relatively small changes in rainfall leads to significant change. To understand and quantify these responses is often difficult as periods of low and high rainfall and associated discharge may be symptomatic of particular regions ands climate regimes (Erskine and Warner, 1988; Verdon et al., 2004).The fluvial system could be described in terms of inputs such as rainfall which is ultimately manifested in outputs such as an erosion response (Knighton, 1998). Pulsed inputs and ramped inputs can produce different sediment and morphological response. The pulsed input or high discharge events can route water and sediment outside the channel boundaries producing channel breakouts, new channels being cut, breakouts and avulsions and in large river systems the shortening and cut-off of meanders (Knighton, 1998). Whereas it is generally recognised that events of ramped change produce incremental erosion where the movement of soil is slow and gradual and are more likely the result of long-term climate shifts (Knighton, 1998; Erskine and Warner 1988 Nicholas and Quinne, 2007). While changes in a catchment may be predicated by the intensity and magnitude of the rainfall event (Solyom and Tucker, 2004), the catchment history (i.e. the surface topography and former channels that may reactivate) is also an important factor, as well as vegetation and human management practices.The modelling results here demonstrate the sensitivity of the catchment to different rainfall patterns and how relatively small changes in rainfall can lead to much larger sediment outputs revealing sensitivity to subtle changes in climate. Channel movement occurs as an avulsion. This is the first time such a process has been observed and modeled in an ephemeral stream environment and demonstrates fluvial geomorphic change at human time scales. Overall the CAESAR landscape evolution and erosion model used in this study is able to replicate both erosion rates and the variation in past channel movement.",19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011),,,,1874,1880,,,,MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM),"DEC 12-16, 2011","CSIRO; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr; Perth Convent Bur; Curtin Univ; Australian Math Soc; Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math; Australian Math Sci Inst; Maralte Publishers; Econ Soc Australian; HEMA Consulting; Simulat Australia; Stat Soc Australia Inc; Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc; Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat","Perth, AUSTRALIA",,978-0-9872143-1-7,WOS:000314989301124

Distinguishing the role of different extinction drivers and their potential interactions is crucial for achieving conservation goals. While some authors argue that invasive species are a main driver of native species declines, others see their proliferation as a co-occurring process to biodiversity loss driven by habitat degradation. It is difficult to discern between the two potential causes given that few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat degradation, and that both factors may interact in different ways.Here we analyze the relative importance of habitat degradation and invasive species in the decline of native fish assemblages in the Guadiana River basin (southwestern Iberian Peninsula) using an information theoretic approach to evaluate interaction pathways between invasive species and habitat degradation (structural equation modeling, SEM). We also tested the possible changes in the functional relationships between invasive and native species, measured as the per capita effect of invasive species, using ANCOVA.We found that the abundance of invasive species was the best single predictor of natives' decline and had the highest Akaike weight among the set of predictor variables examined. Habitat degradation neither played an active role nor influenced the per capita effect of invasive species on natives. Our analyses indicated that downstream reaches and areas close to reservoirs had the most invaded fish assemblages, independently of their habitat degradation status. The proliferation of invasive species poses a strong threat to the persistence of native assemblages in highly fluctuating environments. Therefore, conservation efforts to reduce native freshwater fish diversity loss in Mediterranean rivers should focus on mitigating the effect of invasive species and preventing future invasions.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,21,1,,175,188,,10.1890/09-2011.1,,,,,,1051-0761,,WOS:000288850200015
"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2011,"Hladyz, Sally; Watkins, Susanne C.; Whitworth, Kerry L.; Baldwin, Darren S.",Flows and hypoxic blackwater events in managed ephemeral river channels,"As pressure increases on the availability of water resources worldwide, especially in the face of climatic change, it is probable that the likelihood of streams undergoing at least some periods of drying will increase in arid and semi-arid regions. This has implications for the ongoing management of waterways in these areas. One area of concern is the potential occurrence of hypoxic blackwater events upon reinstatement of flows in creek and river channels following periods of drying. Hypoxic blackwater events are characterised by high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the metabolism of which results in low dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, which can cause fish and crustacean mortality. Therefore, understanding hypoxic blackwater events is important in order to reduce the potential for fish mortalities and other water quality impacts from both managed and natural flows. In this study, we set out to determine the factors that influenced the occurrence of a hypoxic blackwater event in the Edward-Wakool river system, in southern NSW. Australia during the previous austral summer (2008-2009). Standing stocks of plant litter, emergent macrophytes and river red gum saplings (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn.), as well as rates of litterfall, were determined in dry and inundated channels. A series of mesocosm experiments were undertaken to determine which carbon source was the greatest contributor to DOC and to DO depletion, and what loadings could result in hypoxia. These experiments were then used to create a simple algorithm relating carbon loading in a dry channel to DOC in the overlying water column following inundation. Results revealed that plant litter was the main contributor to water column DOC and to DO depletion. Litter loadings equal to or greater than 370 g m(-2) were found to cause DO in a shallow (20 cm) water column at 20 degrees C to fall to zero within two days. This loading was approximately half of that found in dry channels in the Edward-Wakool system - thus, initial inundation of these channels at a low flow rate during summer (or when water temperature is equal to or greater than 20 degrees C) is highly likely to trigger a hypoxic blackwater event. In addition, one month of litterfall in summer was calculated to be sufficient to deliver enough carbon to dry channels to create a hypoxic blackwater event. These findings suggest that to reduce the likelihood of a hypoxic blackwater event occurring as a result of managed flows in ephemeral systems; (1) the principal source(s) of DOC as well as the pathway and timing of accumulation in dry channels should be identified, and (2) the timing of the re-instatement of flows in a dry channel should be considered in light of the timing of maximum rates of accumulation of the principal source(s) of DOC.

We examined what habitats act as refuges for fishes during summer drying, hypothesizing that pools would act as refuge habitats. We predicted that during drying fish would show directional movement into pools from riffle habitats, survival rates would be greater in pools than in riffles, and fish abundance would increase in pool habitats. We examined movement, survival and abundance of three minnow species, bigeye shiner (Notropis hoops), highland stoneroller (Campostoma spadiceum) and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), during seasonal stream drying in an Ozark stream using a closed robust multi-strata mark-recapture sampling. Population parameters were estimated using plausible models within program MARK, where a priori models are ranked using Akaike's Information Criterion. Creek chub showed directional movement into pools and increased survival and abundance in pools during drying. Highland stonerollers showed strong directional movement into pools and abundance increased in pools during drying, but survival rates were not significantly greater in pools than riffles. Bigeye shiners showed high movement rates during drying, but the movement was non-directional, and survival rates were greater in riffles than pools. Therefore, creek chub supported our hypothesis and pools appear to act as refuge habitats for this species, whereas highland stonerollers partly supported the hypothesis and bigeye shiners did not support the pool refuge hypothesis. Refuge habitats during drying are species dependent. An urgent need exists to further understand refuge habitats in streams given projected changes in climate and continued alteration of hydrological regimes.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,513,522,,10.1007/s00027-011-0206-7,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000296533400006

Using an environmental history approach we assess the extent of change in plant cover at 32 sites using repeat photographs that cover a time span of 36-113 years. The results indicate that in the majority of sites there has been a significant increase in cover of riparian vegetation in both the channel beds and adjacent floodplain environments. The most important species to have increased in cover across the region is Acacia karroo. We interpret the findings in the context of historical changes in climate and land use practices. Damage to riparian vegetation caused by mega-herbivores probably ceased sometime during the early 19th century as did scouring events related to large floods that occurred at regular intervals from the 15th to early 20th centuries. Extensive cutting of riparian vegetation for charcoal and firewood has also declined over the last 150 years. Changes in the grazing history as well as increased abstraction and dam building along perennial rivers in the region also account for some of the changes observed in riparian vegetation during the second half of the 20th century. Predictions of climate change related to global warming anticipate increased drought events with the subsequent loss of species and habitats in the study area. The evidence presented here suggests that an awareness of the region's historical ecology should be considered more carefully in the modelling and formulation of future climate change predictions as well as in the understanding of climate change impacts over time frames of decades and centuries.",JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY,44,1,,59,80,,10.1007/s10739-010-9246-4,,,,,,0022-5010,,WOS:000288714200004

The highly variable hydrology of dryland rivers has important implications for population dynamics in these systems. In western Queensland, fluctuations in sub-population size are likely to lead to local bottlenecks and extinctions, increasing the need for connectivity and gene flow to maintain population viability.2. Using microsatellite markers, we explored evidence for this metapopulation structure in two species of freshwater fish (Maquaria ambigua and Tandanus tandanus) and one crustacean (Macrobrachium australiense) in a sub-catchment of the upper Murray-Darling Basin, Australia.3. Overall, we found very weak genetic structure for all three species. Two species (M. ambigua and M. australiense) showed some significant genetic structure that did not correlate with geographic distance. However, decomposed pairwise regression analysis revealed evidence for intense genetic drift at the waterhole scale, suggesting that local bottlenecks are driving what little genetic structure does exist for these species.4. The results identify the local impact of bottlenecks on genetic diversity, but highlight the importance of gene flow in maintaining population viability in these highly variable systems. As the impacts of bottlenecks are likely to be tempered by gene flow, it is suggested that the maintenance of connectivity is of paramount importance in this dryland system.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,56,11,,2378,2390,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02666.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000296061400014

We used the length-frequency distributions of multiple fish species in multiple seasons and highly variable hydrological conditions to infer antecedent breeding behaviour in rivers of far-western Queensland, Australia. Hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) recruitment of some or all species of fish would occur within waterholes during no-flow periods; (2) there would be seasonal recruitment responses in some fish species; (3) recruitment of some species would be enhanced by channel flows and/or flooding. Hydrology and the incidence of flooding were highly variable across the study area during 2006-2008. Flood-influenced recruitment was evident for Hyrtl's tandan, Barcoo grunter and Welch's grunter. Silver tandan, golden goby, Cooper Creek catfish and Australian smelt showed evidence of seasonal recruitment unrelated to antecedent hydrology. However, most species demonstrated continual recruitment in isolated waterholes, irrespective of antecedent flow conditions and season. Continual and seasonal recruitment capabilities have obvious advantages over flood-pulse recruitment in rivers with highly unpredictable flood regimes and underpin the persistence of many fish species in arid and semiarid rivers.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,62,10,,1178,1190,,10.1071/MF11021,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000295720400002

Four river reaches (areas) with distinct hydrogeomorphological characteristics within the distributary zone of the lower Macquarie River were chosen for analysis of abiotic and biotic variables in their in-stream environments. The results showed marked longitudinal spatial variation in the values within and among the measured environmental variables including such functional aspects as primary productivity and PR. The variables that tended to have increasing values in a downstream direction were conductivity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), dissolved silica, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), ratio of DOC/DON and counts of planktonic bacteria. Conversely, the values that tended to decrease downstream were the ratios of TN/TP, DIN/DRP, DOC/DOP, DON/DOP and GPP/PR. Variables that had a localized peak(s) were dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, GPP, PR and counts of cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, cryptomonads, protozoans, rotifers, copepods and cladocerans. Overall, two distinct ecological zones were identified within the broader distributary functional process zone (FPZ): these being the upstream zone with relatively high levels of DO, turbidity, diatoms and GPP/PR ratio, and the downstream zone with relatively high levels of nutrients, dissolved organic matter, cyanobacteria, planktonic bacteria, protozoans and cladocerans.

R.","Water allocation and management in an emerging spate irrigation system in Makanya catchment, Tanzania","Although spate irrigation systems are risk-prone, they can be an important component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, spate irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate irrigation systems pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream-downstream interactions between users within the system, and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and intake structures. This paper describes a spate irrigation system in Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic and sociological) of spate irrigation proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997) to assess the Makanya spate irrigation system. The Makanya spate irrigation system has an organisational structure that is similar to the canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively deals with the institutional demands of managing water in spate irrigation systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional spate irrigation practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots. Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect the existing locally developed water management arrangements.

Assessment,2011,"Law, Bradley S.; Chidel, Mark; Tap, Patrick",Bat activity in ephemeral stream-beds in the Pilliga forests: clarifying the importance of flyways and buffer widths in open forest and woodland,"Riparian zones provide significant habitat for microbats. In forests subject to logging, buffers are normally retained along stream-beds to maintain water quality and protect riparian vegetation and its associated fauna. We sampled bat activity as part of a broader program to assess biodiversity and to provide a scientific basis for determining buffer widths around ephemeral streams in the Pilliga State forests of north-west New South Wales. Anabat detectors recorded bat activity over two consecutive nights in one season at each of three dry stream-bed sizes (small, medium and large), clustered into five different locations (replicates). Anabat detectors were placed at varying distances perpendicular from the dry, stream-bed centre of ephemeral streams (0 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m). To assess the influence on bat activity of the flyway per se versus the riparian zone, one cluster of sites represented a control or reference that comprised dirt roads of three equivalent widths. Over the course of the study 22,967 bat calls were recorded from 15 species. A multivariate analysis of species composition indicated that there was no distinct bat assemblage characteristic of the riparian zone. Overall, bat activity was not influenced by stream-bed size or the perpendicular distance from the stream-bed. However, there was a significant interaction between distance and stream-bed size, with large stream-beds supporting three times more activity over the channels than adjacent forest and woodland. Similarly for reference sites, there was more activity directly over the road than adjacent woodland. The response of individual species to flyways on the different-sized stream-beds varied generally in accordance with predictions based on their ecomorphology and echolocation call type. We conclude that large flyways have the most biological importance to the activity of a range of bat species and that, in conjunction with studies on other components of biodiversity, the riparian zone rarely extends beyond the stream-bed channel in the Pilliga forests.",BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF AUSTRALASIAN BATS,,,,308,321,,,,Symposium on the Biology and Conservation of Australasian Bats,"APR 12-14, 2007",Royal Zool Soc New S Wales; Australasian Bat Soc,"Sydney, AUSTRALIA",,978-0-98-3272-4-3,WOS:000306448900029
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2011,"Lawrence, Justin E.; Deitch, Matthew J.; Resh, Vincent H.",Effects of vineyard coverage and extent on benthic macroinvertebrates in streams of Northern California,"Vineyards are a dominant feature of many landscapes in Mediterranean-climate regions. We examined the effects of streamflow declines, associated with vineyard water-withdrawals for frost protection, on benthic-macroinvertebrate communities at three sites along three small streams in the Mediterranean-climate region of Northern California. One site was heavily affected by water withdrawals for frost protection, the other two were not. In addition, we examined relationships between vineyard coverage and benthic-macroinvertebrate community response using data from 59 sampling events at 39 sites along 35 small streams in Napa County, California. We tested three a priori hypotheses in terms of the response of biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates to high vineyard coverage: (1) proportion of individuals with semi-voltine (i.e., one generation every 2 years) life cycles would be lower compared to those with uni- and multi-voltine cycles, (2) proportion of individuals able to undergo diapause would be higher, and (3) proportion of individuals with the ability to burrow into the substrate would be higher. In the three-site study, we found that vineyard water-withdrawals for frost protection coincided with consistently lower values in both the benthic-macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for Northern California streams and the ratio of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera to Odonata-Coleoptera-Hemiptera individuals (EPT/OCH), a metric developed for European Mediterranean streams. In the broader-scale study, we observed that vineyard-coverage levels above about 20% coincided with lower values of the B-IBI. The semi-voltine life-cycle trait was lower above this level, whereas the diapause and burrowing traits were not affected.",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,47,4,,347,354,,10.1051/limn/2011043,,,,,,0003-4088,,WOS:000301281600004

Although fish are widely used as biological indicators, the tolerance categories currently available for Spanish Mediterranean fish species are uncertain or subjective. We sampled 430 sites covering a wide range of river conditions, allowing us to develop tolerance scores based on a quantitative assessment. We used indirect ordination methods to establish stress gradients between the environmental variables compiled during the monitoring surveys carried out from 2002 to 2008. We then drew up a tolerance classification for the most common species in our dataset using weighted average inference models based on the following gradients: water quality and the state of physical habitat. The results were corroborated by multivariate gradient analysis. The fish scores obtained were applied to an independent dataset and a positive correlation was found between assessment protocols. Our results corroborate the use of fish, including exotic fish species, as biological indicators. Our findings may be used in a regional Index of Biotic Integrity and for the use of fish in bioassessment studies based on scores.

The pools were examined to better understand the quality of sediments and temporary waters in a dryland system with a well-established metal contamination problem. Water and sediment sampling was conducted at the beginning of the hydroperiod in May and September 2007. Water samples were analyzed for major solute compositions (Ca, Na, K, Mg, Cl, SO4, HCO3) and water-soluble (operationally defined as the <0.45 mu m fraction) metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn). Sediment samples were analyzed for total extractable and bioaccessible metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), elemental composition and grain morphology. At the time of sampling a number of pools contained water and sediment with elevated concentrations, compared to Australian regulatory guidelines, of Cu (maximum: water 28 mu g L-1; sediment 770 mg kg(-1)), Pb (maximum: water 3.4 mu g L-1; sediment 630 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (maximum: water 150 mu g L-1; sediment 780 mg kg(-1)). Concentrations of Cd and As in pools were relatively low and generally within Australian regulatory guideline values. Localized factors, such as the interaction of waters with anthropogenic contaminants from modern and historic mine wastes (i.e. residual smelter and slag materials), exert influence on the quality of pool waters. Although the pools of the upper Leichhardt River catchment are contaminated, they do not appear to be the primary repository of water and sediment associated metals when compared to materials in the remainder channel and floodplain. Nevertheless, a precautionary approach should be adopted to mitigating human exposure to contaminated environments, which might include the installation of appropriate warning signs by local health and environmental authorities.",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,13,7,,2050,2061,,10.1039/c0em00396d,,,,,,1464-0325,,WOS:000292984100022
"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2011,"Mannina, Giorgio",Uncertainty Assessment of a Water-Quality Model for Ephemeral Rivers Using GLUE Analysis,"Every model is, by definition, a simplification of the system under investigation. Although it would be desirable to reduce the gap between the simulated and the observed behaviors of the system to zero, this reduction is generally impossible owing to the unavoidable uncertainties inherent in any modeling procedure. Uncertainty analyses can provide useful insights into the best model approach to be used for obtaining results with a high level of significance and reliability. The evaluation of parameter uncertainties is necessary for calibration and for estimating the impact of these uncertainties on model performance. In this context, the uncertainty of a river water-quality model developed in previous studies is presented. The main goal is to gain insights into the modeling approaches concerning small rivers. Previous works generally focused on modeling the large river while neglecting the small one. Following a model calibration, the model uncertainty has been assessed by means of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The results showed that the biological process related to the biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal influenced mainly by the parameters characterizing deoxygenation and nitrogen removal. On the other hand, the biological processes related to nitrogen removal were influenced not only by the parameters related to the nitrogen removal but also to oxygen concentration. The application of the GLUE methodology shows that the river quality model considered is suitable for simulating the important processes involved. Uncertainty bounds showed different amplitudes with respect to the pollutant species considered. In particular, the oxygen uncertainty bounds were narrower with respect to the other model components suggesting much attention must be paid to both model algorithms and quality data to be gathered. The study confirmed the suitability of the GLUE methodology as a powerful tool as a simplified screening methodology to assess uncertainty. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000312.

Biogeochemistry,2011,"Martin, Rebecca A.; Harms, Tamara K.; Grimm, Nancy B.",Chronic N loading reduces N retention across varying base flows in a desert river,"Stream ecosystems receive and transport nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems and are important sites of N retention and removal in catchments. Many streams experience high anthropogenic N loading, which can overwhelm N retention and removal mechanisms and cause large downstream fluxes. Small, headwater streams are important sites of N retention, but the role of streams in larger catchments or as discharge increases is less clear. We evaluated how NO3- uptake dynamics responded to chronic N loading at different sites in a river draining a large desert catchment (similar to 7600 km(2)). Based on nutrient saturation theory, we predicted that chronic N loading would result in decreased uptake efficiency. Previous research suggested that increasing stream discharge also is associated with decreasing N-uptake efficiency. We addressed these relationships for a desert river by examining NO3- uptake dynamics over variable stream discharge encompassing its long-term range in base flow. We used short-term nutrient-addition studies to estimate uptake parameters for NO3- in a reference reach and a reach subject to chronic NO3- input. NO3- uptake efficiency was lower in the N-enriched reach than in the reference reach. However, within a reach, temporal changes in discharge and N concentration did not always affect uptake efficiency as predicted; e.g., pulses of high N flux following monsoon-season flooding did not result in reduced uptake efficiency. Estimates of denitrification rates indicated that this N-removal process was only a small fraction of N uptake, a result suggesting that most N is temporarily retained and eventually is exported downstream. N concentration exerted the primary influence on NO3- uptake efficiency in this large desert stream. However, within reaches, other factors that influence N retention, including floods, biota, and variable flow paths, probably contributed to observed temporal variation.",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,30,2,,559,572,,10.1899/09-137.1,,,,,,0887-3593,,WOS:000290361600018
Assessment,2011,"Masoud, Alaa A.","Runoff modeling of the wadi systems for estimating flash flood and groundwater recharge potential in Southern Sinai, Egypt","Evaluating the likelihood of a flash flood as well as flood water resource is vital for establishing properly sustainable developments in arid environments. However, the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in hydrometeorological processes and the general lack of suitable data limit these efforts. In the present work, a runoff model, adopting the simple Soil Conservation Service method, was built for 13 ungauged catchments in Southern Sinai, Egypt. Runoff modeling was conducted as a function of the descriptive parameters of the catchments, and the maximum average rainfall occurred in 1 day in the period 1960-1990, designed according to a storm event recorded at the outlet of one of the studied catchments on the 2nd of November 1994. The catchments' descriptive parameters were extracted from available remote sensing data and field investigations. Land covers including road networks and 83 rock-soil types were also extracted from the maximum likelihood classification of the Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. The catchments were then subdivided into 103 smaller subcatchments, which were then placed into different terrain types according to hydrologically relevant surface characteristics. Hydrologic characteristics and soil type(s) in the subcatchments were estimated during on-site visits. Morphometric parameters of the wadi catchments and the channel networks were derived from the analysis of the SRTM3 digital elevation model (DEM). Hydrographs were drawn and routed to the main catchment outlets based on appropriate wadi dimensions and roughness using the Muskingum's method. The runoff and infiltration volumes were quantified. The resulting models have been used to investigate the relative potential for flooding and the groundwater recharge in the catchments. Further, in order to determine specific sites with a high potential for flood risk and groundwater recharge, decision-ruled integrated analysis of the generated GIS layers describing relative stream power and wetness indices were applied. Due to the lack of flow data, the results of the hydrological models were validated against the DEM-derived relative stream power and the wetness indices as well as against field checks and available reports as an alternative. The results of this study could help to prioritize areas where flood control measures should be directed, as well as effectively augment management plans for the appropriate development of water resources.",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,4,41795,,785,801,,10.1007/s12517-009-0090-9,,,,,,1866-7511,,WOS:000293235600008
Fish,2011,"Medeiros, Elvio S. F.; Arthington, Angela H.",Allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources for fish in floodplain lagoons of an Australian dryland river,"Dryland rivers associated with arid and semi-arid land areas offer an opportunity to explore food web concepts and models of energy sources in systems that experience unpredictable flooding and long dry spells. This study investigated the sources of energy supporting three species of fish feeding at different trophic levels within floodplain lagoons of the Macintyre River in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling river system, Australia. Stable isotope analyses revealed that fish consumers derived, on average, 46.9% of their biomass from zooplankton, 38.1% from Coarse Particulate Organic Matter (CPOM) and 24.0% from algae. Ambassis agassizii derived on average 57.6% of its biomass carbon from zooplankton and 20.4-27.8% from algae or CPOM. Leiopotherapon unicolor derived most of its carbon from zooplankton and CPOM (38.3-39.5%), with relatively high contributions from algae compared to the other species (33.3%). An average of 48.4% of the biomass of Nematalosa erebi was derived from zooplankton, with CPOM contributing another 38.1%. Zooplankton was the most important source of organic carbon supporting all three fish species in floodplain lagoons. Phytoplankton, and possibly, particulate organic matter in the seston, are the most likely energy sources for the planktonic suspension feeders (zooplankton) and, consequently, the fish that feed on them. These results indicate a stronger dependence of consumers on autochthonous sources and on locally produced organic matter from the riparian zone (i.e., the Riverine Productivity Model), than on other resources.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,90,1,,1,17,,10.1007/s10641-010-9706-x,,,,,,0378-1909,,WOS:000285061500001
Biogeochemistry,2011,"Menendez, Margarita; Descals, Enrique; Riera, Tecla; Moya, Oscar",Leaf litter breakdown in Mediterranean streams: effect of dissolved inorganic nutrients,"Agricultural runoff and urban activities can increase the inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), into headwater streams, leading to eutrophication and thus substantially affecting the structure and functions of benthic communities. A high P concentration in water stimulates the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms associated with leaf litter and, hence, influences decomposition rates and the availability of detrital resources for macroinvertebrates. Litter breakdown of alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaves enclosed in coarse mesh bags was studied in five low-order Mediterranean streams with different trophic status defined by their soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations. Decomposition rates differed significantly between these streams and increased with the eutrophication gradient, but these differences were not always related to the availability of P in water. Leaf mass loss was directly correlated with shredder density, but macroinvertebrate density and diversity were not related to P availability in water, and ammonium concentration had a negative effect on macroinvertebrate diversity and shredder relative abundance. A significantly positive effect of nitrate concentration in water on aquatic hyphomycete sporulation rates was observed, but there also was a negative effect of % ammonium on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The predominantly available ionic form of DIN could thus affect the structure of the aquatic hyphomycete community. These results suggest that the response of litter decomposition to eutrophication in forested headwater streams is strongly influenced by local stream characteristics and by the nature of nutrient pollution.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,669,1,,143,155,,10.1007/s10750-011-0657-9,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000290678600010

Biomass and chlorophyll a recovered quickly (< 2 weeks), and were significantly higher for light-than for dark-exposed biofilms. There was no consistent effect of WWTP inputs on these parameters, except for the biomass on dark-exposed biofilm that was higher at the WWTP-influenced sites. The influence of the WWTP inputs on stream-water ammonium concentration and its isotopic (15)N signature increased as the flood receded. Biofilm (15)N downstream of WWTP increased over time, tracking the increase in (15)N-ammonium from the WWTP waters.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2011,"Merseburger, Gora; Marti, Eugenia; Sabater, Francesc; Ortiz, Jesus D.",Point-source effects on N and P uptake in a forested and an agricultural Mediterranean streams,"We examined the effect of point-source inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) on in-stream uptake of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate and compared it between two streams draining catchments with contrasting land use. The selected streams were La Tordera and Gurri (NE Spain), draining a forest- and an agriculture-dominated catchment, respectively. In each stream, we compared nutrient uptake metrics, estimated from nutrient additions, between two reaches located upstream and downstream of a WWTP input.Measurements were done on 8-9 dates during 2002-2003. In La Tordera, the point-source increased concentrations of all studied nutrients; whereas in Gurri, this effect was less evident. Point-source effects on nutrient uptake differed between the two streams, and among solutes. In La Tordera, uptake lengths (S(w)) of ammonium and phosphate averaged hundreds of meters above the point-source, and increased (i.e., decreased uptake efficiency) 4 and 5 times, respectively, below the point-source. S(w) of nitrate was >= 2 km regardless of reach location. In Gurri, S(w) of all studied nutrients was within the km range in the two reaches. In this stream, diffuse nutrient inputs from adjacent fields may overwhelm the local effect of the point-source input.Uptake velocities (v(f)) of the studied nutrients ranged between 10EXP(-6) and 10EXP(-4) m/s in the two streams, and were similar between the two reaches in each stream. However, phosphate vf decreased under increasing concentrations following a power function. This trend remained significant when combining our results with those compiled from literature, suggesting the efficiency loss response may be a general trend for phosphate across streams.The relative increases in uptake rates (U) below the point-source were proportional to the relative point-source contribution to downstream nutrient loads, especially for ammonium and nitrate. However, the increases in U were not enough to compensate for the increases in nutrient loads downstream of the WWTP input. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Selective exclusions of vertebrate predators or putative small mammal competitors, or both, have yielded relatively small or mostly transitory effects, or both, on small mammal population dynamics and plant community composition. During the study period 5 El Nino-high rainfall episodes have occurred lasting 1-3 years. Resident or core small mammals such as Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini, and Octodon degus experience dramatic fluctuations during and following rainfall pulses. Temporary resident or opportunistic species such as Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and A. longipilis disappear from the thorn scrub for varying periods of time. All species persist in more mesic nearby habitats near dry stream courses (aguadas). Since a 3-year high rainfall event in 2000-2002 mean annual rainfall has increased in this region, mainly due to a lack of prolonged droughts. Under these conditions, and building on a qualitative model proposed by Noy-Meir, long-lived species might become more abundant. Changes in the small mammal assemblage are consistent with these predictions; O. degus, a caviomorph rodent with a long life span, now comprises a more constant proportion of the small mammal biomass in the thorn scrub, and we have documented reduced variation in species diversity. Increased rainfall, a predicted consequence of global climate change in this region, might be leading to changes in small mammal assemblage structure and composition and ultimately will result in a more stable, less oscillatory assemblage in the thorn scrub. Additionally, invasive groups such as introduced lagomorphs and ephemeral plants might become more abundant in this community. The long-term consequences of changes in rainfall patterns due to El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSOs), with important teleconnections to global-scale phenomena, will lead to diverse changes at the community level here.",JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,92,6,,1223,1235,,10.1644/10-MAMM-S-267.1,,,,,,0022-2372,,WOS:000298490800006

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can induce lethal and sub-lethal effects in exposed biota via hypoxic blackwater events and the toxicity of leached compounds. Little is known of how DOC exposure affects fish reproduction despite the fact that its release can coincide with spawning-associated flow pulses.2. River red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) leaf leachate is a major source of DOC in Australian freshwaters and includes the toxic plant secondary metabolites polyphenols and tannins. High concentrations of leachate are released when leaves on floodplains or dry stream channels are inundated by water.3. Southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) from naturally high and naturally low Eucalyptus leachate environments in south-east Australia were exposed to elevated leachate levels to investigate the effects of DOC on reproduction and to explore whether response patterns were consistent with populations becoming locally adapted to historical leachate levels.4. Fish exposed to leachate were half as likely to reach sexual maturity as control fish. Fish from a naturally high-exposure population tended to reach sexual maturity earlier than those from a naturally low-exposure population. Leachate exposure had no effect on either egg size or fecundity.5. Our results suggest that leachate-exposed mothers did not reproduce because they were physiologically stressed or perceive the environment to be unsuitable, which raises the potential of plastic or adaptive responses to this stressor. The negative sub-lethal effects observed have important fitness implications for individuals, the viability of populations and the management of environmental flows and riparian zones.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,56,9,,1736,1745,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02605.x,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000293523200003

M.; Martinez-Capel, F.",Data-driven fuzzy habitat suitability models for brown trout in Spanish Mediterranean rivers,"In recent years, fuzzy models have been acknowledged as a suitable approach for species distribution modelling due to their transparency and their ability to incorporate the ecological gradient theory. Specifically, the overlapping class boundaries of a fuzzy model are similar to the transitions between different environmental conditions. However, the need for ecological expert knowledge is an important constraint when applying fuzzy species distribution models. Moreover, the consistency of the ecological preferences of some fish species across different rivers has been widely contested. Recent research has shown that data-driven fuzzy models may solve this 'knowledge acquisition bottleneck' and this paper is a further contribution. The aim was to analyse the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario L) habitat preferences based on a data-driven fuzzy modelling technique and to compare the resulting fuzzy models with a commonly applied modelling technique, Random Forests. A heuristic nearest ascent hill-climbing algorithm for fuzzy rule optimisation and Random Forests were applied to analyse the ecological preferences of brown trout in 93 mesohabitats. No significant differences in model performance were observed between the optimal fuzzy model and the Random Forests model and both approaches selected river width, the cover index and flow velocity as the most important variables describing brown trout habitat suitability. Further, the fuzzy model combined ecological relevance with reasonable interpretability, whereas the transparency of the Random Forests model was limited. This paper shows that fuzzy models may be a valid approach for species distribution modelling and that their performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art modelling techniques like Random Forests. Fuzzy models could therefore be a valuable decision support tool for river managers and enhance communication between stakeholders. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Invertebrate, Assessment",2011,"Munne, Antoni; Prat, Narcis",Effects of Mediterranean climate annual variability on stream biological quality assessment using macroinvertebrate communities,"Data on macroinvertebrates of selected reference sites were compiled from a long-term monitoring programme carried out in the Mediterranean Catalan Basins (NE Spain) that permitted analysis for nine years, from 1996 to 2004, using a homogeneous data collection procedure. This study aims to analyse the differences in composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities at family level in five Mediterranean river types, and the values of biological quality metrics (IBMWP and IASPT indices, taxon richness and EFT) in reference conditions. Also differences between seasons (spring vs. summer) and between dry and wet periods were analysed. The dry and wet periods were determined using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). A total of 29 reference sites were selected out of 184 sampling sites analysed, and 171 reference samples were available (from 1996 to 2004), of which 88 were sampled in dry periods, whereas 83 correspond to wet periods. Differences on community composition at family level were appreciated, clustering the rivers in three different groups: (1) rivers with a continuous flow regime located in siliceous zones: (2) rivers with a continuous flow regime located in calcareous zones: and (3) temporary rivers regardless of geology. Moreover, our results explain that the characteristics of hydrological periods (dry and wet) characterize the differences between communities better than just the season. The analysis of four biological quality metrics reveals clear differences between values obtained from dry and wet periods concerning taxon richness, EPT values and IBMWP biological indices, whereas the IASPT index does not show significant differences. The median taxonomic richness in wet periods is 32 macroinvertebrate families per sample while in dry periods this value falls to 22. Reference values of IBMWP index, the total number of taxa, and EPT metric are different between dry and wet periods in spring samples, while these differences are not relevant for IASPT index except for temporary streams. Hydrological specific conditions should additionally be considered in order to better calculate biological reference conditions, and to properly apply biological quality metrics used to establish the ecological status in Mediterranean rivers, especially in temporary ones. The use of the dry-wet period classification according to the climate characteristic results is a more accurate application of the Water Framework Directive in Mediterranean rivers. Implications of future climate change should be also considered from our results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The Pb-(Ag)-Zn ore deposits are of the high sulphidation vein and stockwork type. There are two main mining sites: San Cristobal-Perules (adjacent to the town of Mazarron) and Pedreras Viejas. The area is located in the southern realm of a Miocene marine basin surrounded by mountains in its western, eastern and southern flanks. A main seasonal river (Rambla de las Moreras) crosses the basin from North to South and is strongly affected by contaminated sediments from the San Cristobal-Perules mining site. The mine tailings are extremely rich in Pb (mean = 12,400 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (mean = 6100 mu g g(-1)). whereas As concentrations are also very high (mean = 650 mu g g(-1)). Our geochemical survey also covered anthropic soils, stream sediments and the so-called almagres deposits (red alum calcines). All these environmental matrices have also very high concentrations of Pb, Zn, As, and Cd compared to our local or world baseline concentrations. The calcines are rich in As (mean = 450 mu g g(-1)), and the main environmental concern relates to the wrong use of these materials as agricultural soils at discrete sites in the district. Besides, the anthropic soils of the district are very rich in Pb (mean = 2550 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (mean = 1870 mu g g(-1)). On the other hand, the seasonal river Rambla de las Moreras receives contaminated sediments from the San Cristobal-Perules old mining site and mine wastes, which results in high concentrations of As (mean = 120 mu g g(-1)), Pb (mean = 2700 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (mean = 1090 mu g g(-1)) in the sediments.

Simulium virgatum was the most abundant benthic insect collected in Whitewater Canyon (Riverside County, CA) after April; however, it was never found in trout farm effluent where the ammonium-nitrogen concentration was > 0.25 mg/liter. S. virgatum densities downstream of the input of water from the Colorado River aqueduct were lower than at other sampling sites in the Whitewater River. Simulium tescorum, an especially anthropophilic black fly, was most abundant during February and March, was not collected from late spring through early autumn, and was found only in the highly enriched, less variable flow of trout farm effluent. The mean concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the trout farm effluent nearly 1 km from the fish holding ponds were ten and two times, respectively, the ambient levels in the Whitewater River upstream of the effluent discharge point. A combination of factors probably contributed to the presence of S. tescorum in the trout farm effluent including homogenization of the flow regime, enrichment of larval resources, and the development of riparian vegetation that provided oviposition and attachment sites.

Drought refuges allow species to survive drying but their use depends on species' traits, and refuge availability depends on landscape structure. This review evaluates the utility of existing ecological concepts for predicting the role of drought refuges for sustaining biodiversity in non-perennial streams. We also suggest traits that may determine invertebrate species' resistance or resilience to prolonged drying. Parts of the likely responses by populations to increased stream drying are described by existing ecological concepts, such as the biological traits of species and their interaction with the habitat templet, barriers to dispersal and metapopulation dynamics, the use of drought refuges, habitat fragmentation and population and landscape genetics. However, the limited knowledge of invertebrate life histories in non-perennial streams restricts our ability to use these concepts in a predictive manner. In particular, reach or pool occupancy by species cannot be accurately predicted, but such predictions are necessary for evaluating potential management actions such as the use of environmental flows to sustain drought refuges during dry periods.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,62,7,,801,810,,10.1071/MF10062,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000293084800003

Like in most small coastal systems, circulation and water renewal in the Aljezur stream exhibit a strong variability due to their dependence on tides, waves, intermittent river flows, and a highly variable morphology. Hence, the problem was approached through a combination of field surveys and the development and application of a hard-coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and fecal contamination model. Salinity and temperature results have shown that mixing and transport in the stream are very sensitive to the river flow and wind forcing. The model is able to represent the main patterns and trends observed in Escherichia coli and fecal enterococcus concentrations along the stream, for different environmental and contamination conditions, suggesting die-off rates on the order of 0.50-0.55 day(-1). Die-off rate and the representation of the sediment-associated processes were identified as the major remaining sources of uncertainty in the model. Results show that, owing to the processes that occur along the stream, fecal bacteria reach the beaches water in numbers that comply with the European Bathing Waters Directive, even during the summer periods when the upstream concentrations are larger. In particular, results suggest a direct relation between the tidal propagation upstream and the reduction of the fecal bacteria concentrations along the stream that can be relevant for the development of a strategy for the management of the system's water safety.",OCEAN DYNAMICS,61,6,,841,856,,10.1007/s10236-011-0392-9,,,,,,1616-7341,,WOS:000292275100009

The effects of long-term nutrient addition at moderate levels were examined in the food web of a forested Mediterranean stream. Basal concentrations of N and P were increased twofold (to c. 750 mu g N) and threefold (to c. 30 mu g P) from ambient concentrations in an experimental reach. Variations in the abundance of microbes (bacteria and algae), meiofauna and macrofauna, microbial processing of organic matter (extracellular enzyme activities) and stoichiometry of biofilms and invertebrates were compared to an upstream control reach during 4 years of artificial nutrient enhancement.2. Effects were faster in the bacterial compartment but more substantial in the algal compartment. Epilithic algal biomass doubled in the enriched section jointly triggered by nutrients and increased light irradiance in winter and early spring. Only a few animal groups reacted to the enrichment, including the meiofaunal Copepoda, linked to their high use of enriched FPOM, and macrofaunal grazers (Ancylus), which followed the large algal biomass increase.3. The enrichment caused biofilm phosphatase activity to decrease, while activities related to the use of algal-related materials (peptidase, beta-glucosidase) increased. Enzymatic activities related to the use of allochthonous organic matter showed only minor and episodic increases.4. Changes in stoichiometric ratios were apparent in the epilithic compartment, but not in the sand sediment or in the FPOM. Increases in P content were delayed for 9 months in epilithic biofilms and for nearly 2 years in the case of N.5. After 2 years of enrichment, the flatworm Schmidtea polychroa (predator), oligochaetes (detritivore) and tadpoles of Bufo bufo (grazer) showed higher per cent N.6. Enrichment effects were produced in spite of flow cessations that occurred commonly in summer.

The study was conducted in northeastern Massachusetts at headwater stream sites of varying flow permanence (perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral). ANOVA confirmed no significant difference in Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') between stream types, demonstrating that non-perennial streams maintain diverse and even macroinvertebrate communities. Whereas taxa richness was equal among intermittent and perennial sites, ephemeral richness was lower due to their significantly lower riffle richness. Qualitatively, two non-perennial sites were higher in grand total H' diversity and taxa richness than perennial sites. Community structure was also related to flow regime, as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) based on taxa presence produced three distinct groups consistent with stream type, and FFG analysis provided further evidence of distinct communities, with a transition in FFGs from perennial to ephemeral sites. This study concludes that non-perennial streams are biologically diverse and maintain distinct benthic communities and therefore contribute to stream biodiversity and river ecosystems.",NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,18,1,,7,26,,,,,,,,1092-6194,,WOS:000302828500002

Here, we analyzed family distribution of brown trout Salmo trutta in the uppermost reaches of the Mediterranean Son River basin by genotyping nine microsatellite loci. Population structure suggested a model of two units heavily affected by hatchery introgression superimposed on a hydrographic pattern. We observed kin-biased spatial distribution, implying limited dispersal of related fish, probably favored by severe climate conditions in this system. However, downstream dispersal was observed for some large adult fish. Variance in family size defined small estimates of effective population sizes (Ne) in all streams. Comparison of estimates by several methods indicated that factors other than variation of family size are responsible for such low values. The population structure in the Son River basin is, then, represented by interconnected locations in which dispersion of the fish is probably conditioned by oscillations in water discharge, particularly the extremely low water flow during summer. Stream discharge variation could also be related to the flexibility of the mating system. Such characteristics make populations especially vulnerable to stocking and to any other potential effects.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,671,1,,105,119,,10.1007/s10750-011-0708-2,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000291740900009

To investigate this assumption, we measured physicochemical parameters, macro-invertebrate colonization, microbial activity, and decay rates of exposed leaves during and after a supra-seasonal drought in a German lowland stream. Microbial activity, shredder colonization and leaf decay rates during fragmentation were low, presumably caused by drought-related environmental conditions. Microbial activity and temperature-corrected decay rates increased after the flow resumption but not leaf mass loss and shredder colonization. During both periods, exposed leaves appeared physically unaffected suggesting strongly reduced shredder-mediated leaf decay despite shredder presence. Our results indicate that hydrological drought can affect organisms and processes in temperate lowland streams even after flow resumption, and should be considered in climate change scenarios.",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,96,6,,633,655,,10.1002/iroh.201111322,,,,,,1434-2944,,WOS:000297650000001

To analyze the benthic community dynamics of an intermittent Mediterranean stream (Fuirosos, Spain), we developed a mechanistic model that describes the most important ecosystem components (five functional feeding groups of invertebrates, periphyton, and benthic organic matter) under consideration of important transformation processes. The model is an extension of that developed for application to the prealpine River Sihl (Switzerland). A combination of prior knowledge from the literature and information from field observations within a Bayesian framework is used to constrain plausible ranges of the estimated model parameters and to evaluate the uncertainty of the model outcome. The Bayesian inference resulted in a realistic description of most of the main features of the system, offered insights into the degree of information the data contains about model parameters, and also made it possible to quantify the dependence structure of the parameter estimates. Local and global sensitivity analyses revealed that rate parameters for growth and death of invertebrate functional feeding groups are most influential on the model results and additional information on these parameters would be most helpful to reduce output uncertainty. The study clearly points out the importance of organic matter dynamics, as allochthonous organic matter is the main energy source in this Mediterranean headwater stream. Hydrological disturbances of the system such as droughts and floods lead to complex colonization patterns which would require additional data to support a more detailed description by an extended model. Furthermore, the study shows that it is possible to deal with a complex ecological model with eight state variables and more than 60 parameters in a Bayesian framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aquatic insects, including Glossosoma spp., Chironominae spp., Stenehnis spp., Rhyacophilla nigrocephala, and Hexatoma spp., were characterized by different feeding strategies. The delta(13)C values for these species indicated that Glossosoma spp. graze upon periphyton; Chironominae and Stenehnis spp. mainly feed on benthic particulate organic matter, and R. nigrocephala and Hexatoma spp., which were identified as predators, feed upon Glossosoma, Stenehnis, and/or Chironominae spp. This suggests that the trophic position of consumers at each station may be determined by the trophic position of basal food sources in situ. For trophic pathways, the delta(13)C values for both organic matter and aquatic insects tended to gradually decrease, whilst the delta(15)N values increased from the upper reach to the lower reaches, relative to the physicochemical and geographical conditions.

Evrotas, an intermittent river located in Southern Greece, was used as a case study to assess the impacts of water stress on Mediterranean lotic ecosystems. Based on hydrological analyses, it was revealed that during prolonged drought years, such as the summers of 2007 and 2008, the vast majority of the Evrotas riverbed was completely desiccated, primarily as a result of substantial water abstraction for irrigation. The effects of desiccation on the riverine ecosystem were evaluated using fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages according to the demands of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD). Faunal responses to water stress were assessed through comparisons of assemblages attributes in perennial and intermittent reaches and pre-drought versus post-drought communities. Effects of hydrological disturbance on fish species richness, density, percentage composition and size structure were more pronounced in intermittent than in perennial sites. The most obvious and immediate impact was the elimination of populations in the intermittent reaches. However, upon flow resumption, the recolonisation from upstream perennial reaches began, thereby permitting partial re-establishment of the depleted fish communities. Nevertheless, the structural integrity of fish communities remained severely impacted and recovery was markedly slow. On the contrary, post-drought macroinvertebrate assemblages were not affected by summer droughts, and the recruitment processes were rapid after flow resumption. Our findings point to the necessity of establishing a distinction between naturally and artificially driven intermittent rivers.

While attention has been given to the responses of aquatic invertebrates to drying rivers, few studies exist on the terrestrial invertebrates colonizing dry river beds. Dry river beds are physically harsh and they often differ substantially in substrate, topography, microclimate and inundation frequency from adjacent riparian zones. Given these differences, we predicted that dry river beds provide a unique habitat for terrestrial invertebrates, and that their assemblage composition differs from that in adjacent riparian zones. Dry river beds and riparian zones in Australia and Italy were sampled for terrestrial invertebrates with pitfall traps. Sites differed in substrate type, climate and flow regime. Dry river beds contained diverse invertebrate assemblages and their composition was consistently different from adjacent riparian zones, irrespective of substrate, climate or hydrology. Although some taxa were shared between dry river beds and riparian zones, 66 of 320 taxa occurred only in dry river beds. Differences were due to species turnover, rather than shifts in abundance, indicating that dry river bed assemblages are not simply subsets of riparian assemblages. Some spatial patterns in invertebrate assemblages were associated with environmental variables (irrespective of habitat type), but these associations were statistically weak. We suggest that dry river beds are unique habitats in their own right.

Although studies in freshwater ecosystems have received recent attention, research has rarely considered the potential trade-offs between protecting different dimensions of biodiversity and the ecological processes that maintain diversity. We provide the first systematic prioritization for freshwaters (focusing on the highly threatened and globally distinct fish fauna of the Lower Colorado River Basin, USA) simultaneously considering scenarios of: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity; contemporary threats to biodiversity (including interactions with nonnative species); and future climate change and human population growth. There was 75% congruence between areas of highest conservation priority for different aspects of biodiversity, suggesting that conservation efforts can concurrently achieve strong complementarity among all types of diversity. However, sizable fractions of the landscape were incongruent across conservation priorities for different diversity scenarios, underscoring the importance of considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity and highlighting catchments that contribute disproportionately to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in the region. Regions of projected human population growth were not concordant with conservation priorities; however, higher human population abundance will likely have indirect effects on native biodiversity by increasing demand for water. This will come in direct conflict with projected reductions in precipitation and warmer temperatures, which have substantial overlap with regions of high contemporary diversity.

Many studies have investigated use of the hyporheic refugium during hydrological extremes (spates and streambed drying), and recent research has linked an increase in the abundance of benthic invertebrates within hyporheic sediments to increasing biotic interactions during flow recession in a temporary stream. This study examined spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone in two groundwater-dominated streams in which flow permanence varied over small areas. Two non-insect taxa, Commands pulex and Polycelis spp. were common to both streams and were investigated in detail. Hydrological conditions in both streams comprised a four-month period of flow recession and low flows, accompanied by reductions in water depth and wetted width. Consequent declines in submerged benthic habitat availability were associated with increases in population densities of mobile benthic taxa, in particular G. pulex. The reduction in the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone was minimal, and this habitat was therefore a potential refugium from increasing biotic interactions in the benthic sediments. Concurrent increases in the hyporheic abundance and hyporheic proportion of a taxon's total (benthic + hyporheic) population were considered as evidence of active refugium use. Such evidence was species-specific and site-specific, with refugium use being observed only for G. pulex and at sites dominated by downwelling water. A conceptual model of spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone during habitat contraction is presented, which highlights the potential importance of the direction of hydrologic exchange.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,73,4,SI,499,511,,10.1007/s00027-011-0203-x,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000296533400005
Fish,2011,"Valdal, Eric J.; Quinn, Michael S.",Spatial Analysis of Forestry Related Disturbance on Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi): Implications for Policy and Management,"A landscape scale analysis of anthropogenic and natural disturbance indicates a significant negative relationship between the cumulative effects of forestry-related activities and the relative abundance of westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, cutthroat trout) in southeastern British Columbia. Cutthroat trout abundance within 6 Kootenay River headwater streams ranged from 0.00 to 0.0325 fish/m2. Univariate analyses within a blocked regression design resulted in statistically significant (p<0.05) negative relationships between cutthroat trout abundance and road density, roads on erodible soils, roads within near-stream zones and two measures of logging to the stream bank. There was no statistically significant relationship between cutthroat trout abundance and equivalent clear-cut area (km(2)/km(2)). Roads over erodible soils within near-stream zones emerged as the most significant individual variable. A multivariate model to predict cutthroat trout abundance included roads within near stream zones and recent logging adjacent to streams. Evidence from this study indicates that logging of non-fish bearing perennial and ephemeral streams is likely a key factor that has negative downstream effects on cutthroat trout abundance. Contrary to many conventional forest management approaches, this study suggests that considering the spatial distribution of disturbance is at least as important as the total amount of disturbance and that disturbance types can accumulate to produce negative effects on cutthroat trout abundance. The forestry-fish relationships that result from this project provide guidance for forest policy and planning, fish habitat monitoring and cutthroat trout conservation management.",APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY,4,2,,95,111,,10.1007/s12061-009-9045-5,,,,,,1874-463X,,WOS:000208705600002

J.",Recharge sources and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in alluvial basins in arid central Australia,"It is necessary to define the role of various sources of recharge in the surficial alluvial aquifer system in arid Alice Springs in central Australia, for future management of water resources in the region. Multiple sources of natural recharge include infiltration from ephemeral stream flow in the Todd River; groundwater throughflow between connected alluvial basins; regional groundwater flow from the underlying Tertiary aquifer; and diffuse recharge. In addition treatment, storage and irrigation reuse of Alice Springs' waste water has resulted in additional recharge of effluent, via infiltration. Water resource management plans for the region include effluent reuse through Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) within one of the connected alluvial basins, with the purpose of managing the excess waste water overflows while also supplementing groundwater resources for irrigation and protecting their quality.Hydrogeochemical tracers, chloride and the stable isotopes of water, were used in a three-member mixing model to define and quantify the major recharge sources. The mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify minor contributions from effluent in groundwater that were identified only by an evaporated isotopic signature. The contribution of the multiple recharge sources varied spatially with proximity to the recharge source; with Todd River, effluent and Town Basin throughflow contributing to the Inner Farm Basin groundwater. The Outer Farm Basin was largely influenced by the Todd River, the Inner Farm Basin throughflow and the older Tertiary aquifer. While Inner Farm groundwater throughflow contains an effluent component, only Outer Farm Basin groundwater near the interface between the two basins clearly illustrated an effluent signature. Aside from this, effluent recharge was not evident in the Outer Farm Basin, indicating that past unmanaged recharge practices will not mask signs of Managed Aquifer Recharge through the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) operation. The long-term impact of effluent recharge is a shift from sodium and calcium as co-dominant cations in the groundwater, as evident in the Outer Farm Basin, to dominance by sodium alone, as typical for the Inner Farm Basin.

In this study, the transport of 6 herbicides and 12 herbicide degradates was examined during the 2004 growing season in an intermediate-scale agricultural watershed (146 ha) that is drained by a first-order intermittent stream, and the mass load for each herbicide in the stream was estimated. The herbicide load during the first week of storm events after application ranged from 17% of annual load for trifluralin to 84% of annual load for acetochlor. The maximum weekly herbicide load in the stream was generally within the first 3 weeks after application for those compounds that were applied within the watershed during 2004, and later for herbicides not applied within the watershed during 2004 but still detected in the stream. The apparent dominant mode of herbicide transport in the stream-determined by analysis amongst herbicide and conservative ion concentrations at different points in the hydrograph and in base flow samples-was either overland runoff or shallow subsurface flow, depending on the elapsed time after application and type of herbicide.

As a consequence of their hydrologic regime, these ecosystems contract and fragment as they dry, and expand after rewetting. Global change leads to a rapid increase in the extent of temporary streams, and more and more permanent streams are turning temporary. Consequently, there is an urgent need to better understand the effects of flow intermittency on the biogeochemistry and ecology of stream ecosystems. Our aim was to investigate how stream nutrient availability varied in relation to ecosystem contraction, fragmentation and expansion due to hydrologic drying and rewetting. We quantified the temporal and spatial changes in dissolved nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations along a reach of a temporary Mediterranean forest stream during an entire contraction-fragmentation-expansion hydrologic cycle. We observed marked temporal changes in N and P concentrations, in the proportion of organic and inorganic forms as well as in stoichiometric ratios, reflecting shifts in the relative importance of in-stream nutrient processing and external nutrient sources. In addition, the spatial heterogeneity of N and P concentrations and their ratios increased substantially with ecosystem fragmentation, reflecting the high relevance of in-stream processes when advective transport was lost. Overall, changes were more pronounced for N than for P. This study emphasizes the significance of flow intermittency in regulating stream nutrient availability and its implications for temporary stream management.

We hypothesized to find differences between species in the rates of establishment and survival as well as in the susceptibility to grazing. We expected species that grow at largest distances to the groundwater table to establish themselves more successfully and have higher survival rates. In addition, we expected the high grazing and browsing pressure in the oasis foreland to have a negative effect on seedling establishment, with less palatable species being less affected. Exclosure experiments were carried out along the banks of an ephemeral river. Seedlings and shoot or rhizome fragments were planted in either fenced or control plots. In addition, the naturally emerging seedlings after a flooding event were monitored for survival to the subsequent vegetation period. In contrast to expectations, the species did not differ in the survival of planted seedlings and vegetative fragments. However, there were significant differences in the density of spontaneously emerging seedlings. Tamarix ramosissima had a much higher seedling density than the other species. Excluding livestock had a positive effect on the survival of planted seedlings and shoot or rhizome fragments. However, there were no species-specific exclosure effects neither effects on the survival of spontaneously emerging seedling. The exclusion of grazers and browsers might generally enhance the vegetation coverage in the oases forelands, but it does not favour different species disproportionately.

Although leaf litter was abundant in the Macquarie River in Tasmania, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested that aquatic macrophytes were more prevalent in shredding macroinvertebrate diets. We tested this result with two multi-choice trials, which examined the feeding preferences of Atalophlebia albiterminata (Ephemeroptera) and the case-building trichopterans Lectrides varians, Notalina bifaria, Triplectides similis and T. ciuskus ciuskus. We first tested preferences for the dominant benthic leaf species (Acacia mucronata, Eucalyptus amygdalina, E. barberi, E. obliqua and E. viminalis). We hypothesised that macroinvertebrates would preferentially select leaves with lower chemical concentrations. However, there were no strong preferences for conditioned leaves by any invertebrate, although the leaves varied in toughness, tannin, nitrogen and allelochemical content. Second, we examined the preferences for E. amygdalina and E. barberi leaves or the fresh macrophytes Triglochin procerum, Myriophyllum salsugineum and Potamogeton tricarinatus. Macrophytes were preferred over leaves by all invertebrates, with T. procerum significantly preferred over the other macrophytes.

Functional group contributions to production were similar along the continuum, with collector-gatherers (40-56% of total) and predators (23-38%) dominating all reaches. Detrital pathways appeared to account for most energy flow in all reaches, and all reaches were net heterotrophic on all dates when metabolism was measured, except for the grass headwater reach in spring. Predators were well-represented and consumed 65-107% of total macroinvertebrate production, whereas scrapers (11-15%), shredders (2-4%), and filterers (< 1%) consumed relatively small percentages of available resources. Dominance of predators suggested top-down controls are important in this system. However, changes in energy flow through other groups reflected longitudinal variation in resource availability.

"Fish, Assessment",2011,"Woodford, Darragh J.; Cochrane, Thomas A.; Mchugh, Peter A.; Mcintosh, Angus R.",Modelling spatial exclusion of a vulnerable native fish by introduced trout in rivers using landscape features: a new tool for conservation management,"1. Habitat variability can affect the ability of invasive predators to exclude native prey species from parts of a landscape. If habitat consistently mediates predator impacts, the outcome of predator-prey interactions could be modelled using habitat data alone.2. In New Zealand streams, invasive predatory trout create source-sink dynamics in populations of the native fish Galaxias vulgaris. Within trout-invaded sink habitat, G. vulgaris are excluded from small, stable streams that occur far from galaxiid demographic sources (streams above barriers to trout).3. A GIS-based spatial model using stream size and distance-to-source data was developed to predict where trout would exclude G. vulgaris in a river network, and to detect undiscovered trout-free source populations. The maximum distance from source streams at which G. vulgaris could co-occur with trout was modelled in two trout-invaded riverscapes using a quantile limit function in GIS. The predictive ability of the model was tested using training datasets and data from two independent catchments where fish occurrence patterns were quantified from electrofishing surveys.4. The model correctly predicted G. vulgaris absence in the first test catchment, but failed to predict absence in the second test dataset because of an initial lack of knowledge of demographic sources and insufficient survey data. This demonstrated that G. vulgaris exclusion by trout could be predicted by the model, provided it is constructed and validated in an iterative fashion.5. The current model provides a useful tool both for conserving critical source populations, as well as for selecting streams for rehabilitation through trout eradication. Since species interaction models based on landscape data are likely to be generally useful in guiding conservation management, researchers should investigate whether other biotic interactions that can be consistently predicted by habitat exist in nature.

"Fish, Assessment",2011,"Woodford, Darragh J.; McIntosh, Angus R.",Location of demographic sources affects the distributions of a vulnerable native fish in invaded river networks,"P> Invasive predators negatively affect native prey to varying degrees across landscapes, and spatial configuration of invader-free refugia may affect prey distributions across invaded river networks. In New Zealand, introduced trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) create source-sink dynamics in native Galaxias vulgaris populations, and their co-occurrence with trout may be enhanced by immigration from trout-free reaches.We investigated how network configuration of trout-free demographic sources affected the distribution of G. vulgaris across trout-invaded riverscapes. Using quantitative biomass surveys and spatially extensive presence-absence surveys, the interaction between habitat variability and location relative to sources in limiting distributions of G. vulgaris in trout-invaded reaches was assessed.Galaxias vulgaris biomass at invaded sink sites decreased with increasing network distance to the nearest trout barrier. The maximum distance to barriers at which G. vulgaris occurred in the riverscape was limited, so that galaxiids were excluded from small and stable streams far from sources.Large predatory trout (i.e. > 150 mm fork length) occurred in high densities at stable sites all year round and were seasonally excluded from sites disturbed by flooding. Large streams probably provide increased refugia for galaxiids to avoid predation from trout, but narrowness and habitat stability may act synergistically to extirpate G. vulgaris from sites that are too far from sources to receive regular immigrants.The interaction between immigration and habitat configuration in mediating effects of trout on G. vulgaris distributions indicates the spatial dependency of predator-prey interactions in river networks.These results indicate creating new invader-free source habitat should enhance co-occurrence in nearby invader-occupied reaches. Moreover, adding source habitat in sink streams far from existing sources, and ensuring barriers prevent future invasion, will also allow native fish dispersal between sources and sinks and will maximise the conservation gains from management across invaded riverscapes.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,56,2,,311,324,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02498.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000285999100009

Amino acids were analyzed in benthic material (epilithic biofilms, sand sediments, leaf material) as well as in the flowing water (dissolved organic matter, DOM). A principal component analysis and the estimation of the amino acid degradation index (DI) elucidated differences in amino acid composition and quality among the wet-drought-wet-cycle. Amino acid content and composition were dependent on the source of OM as well as on its diagenetic state. The highest-quality OM (high DI and high N content) occurred on epilithic biofilms and the most degraded and lowest-quality OM occurred in sandy sediments. Differences between the pre- and post-drought periods were evident in DOM quality; autochthonous-derived material was predominant during the pre-drought (wet period preceding drying), while allochthonous inputs dominated during the post-drought period (wet period following drying). In contrast, benthic OM compartments were more stable, but benthic OM quality decreased continuously throughout the drought period.

H.; Sheldon, F.",Is the hyporheic zone a refuge for macroinvertebrates in drying perennial streams?,"Drought and drying of perennial streams plays a central role in determining the structure of in-stream communities, decreasing taxa richness and abundance and changing trophic organisation. Further, flow cessation can increase spatial beta-diversity of macroinvertebrate communities across disconnected sites. It has been hypothesised that the hyporheic zone may act as a refugium for benthic macroinvertebrates during low flow and flow cessation, but evidence remains equivocal. We explored hyporheic and surface benthic macroinvertebrate community changes associated with low flow and flow cessation conditions during a supra-seasonal drought on two normally perennial rivers: the Cotter and Queanbeyan Rivers ( Canberra, ACT). Surface benthic and hyporheic samples were collected from these two rivers and four associated tributary streams across a drying gradient during dry conditions and after flow recovery to test whether macroinvertebrates in perennial streams utilise the hyporheic zone as a refugium and whether there is greater variability in the macroinvertebrate community at sites experiencing flow cessation compared with wetter sites. Low flow had no impact on macroinvertebrate taxa richness or density in either surface benthic or hyporheic habitats, whereas density and taxa richness declined during streambed drying, suggesting that the hyporheic zone did not provide a refugium for some taxa during these dry conditions. Spatial beta-diversity peaked at dry sites, likely in response to the broad range of environmental conditions that may differ between refuges and sites, but decreased after flow recovery. Refuges in perennial streams appear more vulnerable to human disturbances during dry periods because a loss of suitable refuges can affect the ability of some macroinvertebrate taxa to recolonise after flow recovery.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,62,12,,1373,1382,,10.1071/MF11060,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000297517600003

In deserts, the lateral margins of ephemeral stream channels (parafluvial sediments) are dried and rewetted, creating periodically wet conditions that typically enhance microbial activity. However, the influence of water content on microbial community composition and diversity in desert stream sediments is unclear. We sampled stream margins along gradients of wet to dry sediments, measuring geochemistry and bacterial 16S rRNA gene composition, at streams in both a cold (McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica) and hot (Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico, USA) desert. Across the gradients, sediment water content spanned a wide range (1.6-37.9% w/w), and conductivity was highly variable (12.3-1,380 mu S cm(-2)). Bacterial diversity (at 97% sequence similarity) was high and variable, but did not differ significantly between the hot and cold desert and was not correlated with sediment water content. Instead, conductivity was most strongly related to diversity. Water content was strongly related to bacterial 16S rRNA gene community composition, though samples were distributed in wet and dry clusters rather than as assemblages shifting along a gradient. Phylogenetic analyses showed that many taxa from wet sediments at the hot and cold desert site were related to, respectively, halotolerant Gammaproteobacteria, and one family within the Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes), while dry sediments at both sites contained a high proportion of taxa related to the Acidobacteria.

Our research uses the concept of watershed disproportionality, where coupled social-biophysical conditions bear a disproportionate responsibility for harmful water quality outcomes, to analyze the potential influence of riparian landowner perceptions and attitudes on water quality in headwater regions. We combine social science survey data, aerial imagery, and an analysis of spatial point processes to assess the relationship between riparian landowner perceptions and attitudes in relation to stream flow regularity. Stream flow regularity directly and positively shapes landowners' water quality concerns, and also positively influences landowners' attitudes of stream importance-a key determinant of water quality concern as identified in a path analysis. Similarly, riparian landowners who do not notice or perceive a stream on their property are likely located in headwater regions. Our findings indicate that landowners of headwater streams, which are critical areas for watershed-scale water quality, are less likely to manage for water quality than landowners with perennial streams in an obvious, natural channel. We discuss the relationships between streamflow and how landowners develop understandings of their stream, and relate this to the broader water quality implications of headwater stream mismanagement.",ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,50,5,,849,860,,10.1007/s00267-012-9928-0,,,,,,0364-152X,,WOS:000309870100005

A range of structural [microbial biomass, nutrient content, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)-polysaccharide content] and metabolic (extracellular enzyme activities) descriptors were analyzed during the colonization period of 60 days. The succession of bacterial communities was investigated through the 16S rDNA gene analysis and taxonomical identification was used in diatom communities. Differences in algal biomass were not significant between the two stream biofilms, but the bacterial density and aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase activities were higher in the Mediterranean biofilms, probably due to greater coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) accumulation in the latter. The colonization sequences of algae and bacteria in the biofilms were faster in the Mediterranean stream biofilms and slower and gradual in the Central European stream biofilms. Floods caused disruption in the microbial succession and re-colonization, favouring the re-appearance of early colonizing taxa and increasing the community diversity. Biofilms in the Mediterranean stream had a higher amount of early colonizing species (the diatoms Ulnaria ulna and Karayevia clevei and the beta-proteobacteria group), as well as higher polysaccharide development in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix. These differences could be an adaptation to the marked hydrological changes characteristic of Mediterranean streams.

Having the physiological capacity to both metabolise and catabolise lipids, fish can survive through droughts and rapidly gain condition during flows and floods. Dryland rivers continuously cycle through periods of boom and bust due to their intermittent patterns of rainfall and flow. To help gain an understanding of how fish respond physiologically to varying antecedent flow conditions, we examined body condition measured by percent tissue water content of two generalist fish species in an Australian dryland river. We predicted that fish would be in better condition following recent flows and poorer condition when there had been no recent flows. Our expectations were met for both species with low water tissue content after high flows and high tissue water content after significant drying. It was also found that strong juvenile recruitment was also evident when body condition was high, indicating that when there are food resource spikes driven by flow pulses fish can utilise resources both to produce offspring and to store as lipid for future survival.",FISHERIES SCIENCE,78,4,,841,847,,10.1007/s12562-012-0519-z,,,,,,0919-9268,,WOS:000306123200010

These systems are distinctive features in the semi-arid landscape and comprise a range of associated systems functioning as an ever-changing mosaic of dry/wet patches. Lakes and reservoirs in semi-arid Brazil are subject to important periods of water shortages, whereas rivers and streams are characterized as highly variable and driven by the extremes of water flow and its absence. Within this view a catchment-scale approach must be used to create a holistic model to conceptualize and comprehend these aquatic systems, since the aquatic environment types in the semi-arid region of Brazil incorporate broader aspects within the catchment scale such as geomorphology, vegetation, climate and land use. This paper summarizes some of the information on the aquatic systems of the Brazilian semi-arid region and shows the importance of limnological studies in this region. It also attempts to establish perspectives for future research considering the catchment as a scale for surveying biological processes and limnological characteristics of the various aquatic systems. It is presented information on their overall structure and functioning, as well as characteristics of some biological communities, such as phytoplankton, periphyton, aquatic macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish. The importance of the understanding of eutrophication in reservoirs and the role of the dry phase in streams is emphasized, and information on possible actions of planning and management to improve water quality of reservoirs are presented.",Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia,24,1,,103,118,,,,,,,,2179-975X,,SCIELO:S2179-975X2012000100010

The present study discriminated natural hydrologic variation using two different environmental classifications (REC-Segura and WFD-ecotypes) and tested their agreement with an a posteriori (hydrologic) classification in a Spanish Mediterranean basin (the Segura River, SE Spain). The REC-Segura was developed as a two-level hierarchical classification based on environmental variables that influence hydrology (climate and source-of-flow). The WFD-ecotypes were developed by the Spanish Ministry for the Environment to implement the Water Framework Directive (WFD) using hierarchical hydrologic, morphologic and physicochemical variables. The climate level in the REC-Segura broadly described the hydrologic pattern observed along the NW-SE aridity gradient of the basin. However, source-of-flow (defined by karstic geology) was only able to discriminate variation in flow regimes within one climatic category. The WFD-ecotypes, despite incorporating hydrologic variables, did not fully discriminate hydrologic variation in the basin. Ecotypes in tributary streams located in dry or semiarid climates embrace different flow regimes (both perennial and intermittent). There was little agreement between environmental and hydrologic classifications. Therefore, the authors advise against the use of environmental classifications for the assessment of environmental flows without first testing their ability to discriminate hydrologic patterns.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,26,13,,3803,3817,,10.1007/s11269-012-0104-3,,,,,,0920-4741,,WOS:000308552700009
Biogeochemistry,2012,"Bernal, S.; Sabater, F.",Changes in discharge and solute dynamics between hillslope and valley-bottom intermittent streams,"To gain understanding on how alluvial zones modify water and nutrient export from semiarid catchments, we compared monthly discharge as well as stream chloride, carbon, and nitrogen dynamics between a hillslope catchment and a valley-bottom catchment with a well-developed alluvium. Stream water and solute fluxes from the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments showed contrasting patterns between hydrological transitions and wet periods, especially for bio-reactive solutes. During transition periods, stream water export decreased > 40% between the hillslope and the valley bottom coinciding with the prevalence of stream-to-aquifer fluxes at the alluvial zone. In contrast, stream water export increased by 20-70% between the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments during wet periods. During transition periods, stream solute export decreased by 34-97% between the hillslope and valley-bottom catchments for chloride, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. In annual terms, stream nitrate export from the valley-bottom catchment (0.32 +/- 0.12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) [average +/- standard deviation]) was 30-50% lower than from the hillslope catchment (0.56 +/- 0.32 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The annual export of dissolved organic carbon was similar between the two catchments (1.8 +/- 1 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our results suggest that hydrological retention in the alluvial zone contributed to reduce stream water and solute export from the valley-bottom catchment during hydrological transition periods when hydrological connectivity between the hillslope and the valley bottom was low.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,16,6,,1595,1605,,10.5194/hess-16-1595-2012,,,,,,1027-5606,,WOS:000305829400003
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2012,"Blanchette, Melanie L.; Pearson, Richard G.",Macroinvertebrate assemblages in rivers of the Australian dry tropics are highly variable,"Dryland rivers are globally widespread and regionally important, and understanding their ecology is critical for sustaining ecosystem processes and biodiversity. The dry tropics are characterized by episodic summer rainfall. Most of annual river flow occurs in a short period of time, after which rivers typically contract into a series of waterholes of varying permanence and hydrologic connectivity. We investigated how seasonal environmental factors affected macroinvertebrate assemblage composition in dry-tropics rivers at the river, site, and habitat scales. We assessed biophysical characteristics, including water physicochemistry, riparian-zone condition, and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition at 15 sites on 4 unimpounded rivers in the Burdekin catchment, north Queensland, Australia. We used permutational analysis of variance and multiresponse permutation procedures to identify differences between a priori groups, and illustrated the results with principle components analysis (biophysical data) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (invertebrate assemblage data). Biophysical variables were spatially and temporally variable, and all rivers and most sites differed significantly. Macroinvertebrate assemblages also differed significantly among rivers, sites within rivers, habitats, and seasons. Assemblages from the same habitat but different sites were more similar than assemblages from different habitats within the same site. Thus, the dynamic environment of dryland river systems drives naturally dynamic and variable macroinvertebrate assemblages across a range of scales. The differences among sites from the same river were of particular importance from a monitoring standpoint because they indicated that extrapolating whole-river condition from a few sampled sites would be difficult.",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,31,3,,865,881,,10.1899/11-068.1,,,,,,2161-9565,,WOS:000309905100015
Invertebrate,2012,"Bogan, Michael T.; Boersma, Kate S.",Aerial dispersal of aquatic invertebrates along and away from arid-land streams,"Dispersal is an essential process in metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Most studies of aquatic invertebrate dispersal in streams have focused on in-stream drift of larvae. However, understanding aerial dispersal is important for predicting community assembly in isolated habitats after disturbance or stream restoration. We used artificial pools placed at 3 distances (5, 75, and 250 m) from 1 perennial and 1 ephemeral arid-land stream to examine aerial-dispersal dynamics of aquatic invertebrates over a 6-wk period in summer 2009. We also conducted a 2-wk experiment to examine the relationship between daily rainfall and disperser abundance at the perennial site. Sixty-six aquatic invertebrate taxa (including many Coleoptera and Diptera and fewer Hemiptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and noninsect taxa) colonized the artificial pools. They represented V, of taxa documented from neighboring perennial streams. Abundance and species richness declined with distance away from both streams. This result suggests that ephemeral stream channels may serve as important aerial dispersal corridors for aquatic invertebrates even when no surface water is present. Mean species richness tripled after 58 mm of rain during the 4th wk of the experiment. Data from the 2-wk experiment highlighted the role of rainfall as a dispersal cue in this system. Amount of daily rainfall explained 48 to 77% of the variation in disperser abundance at 5, 75, and 250 m from the perennial site. We used spatiotemporal dispersal patterns observed in our study to identify 5 modes of aerial dispersal among 56 taxa: 1) widespread common, 2) widespread haphazard, 3) range-restricted, 4) cue-limited, and 5) infrequent. Classification of specific aerial-dispersal modes provides a conceptual framework for modeling spatially explicit community responses to disturbance, stream restoration, and climate-change-induced habitat contraction or expansion.",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,31,4,,1131,1144,,10.1899/12-066.1,,,,,,2161-9565,,WOS:000311266300011

The Sandspruit catchment (quaternary catchment G10J) is located in the Western Cape Province of South Africa and is a tributary of the Berg River. It contributes significantly to the salinisation of the mid-to lower-reaches of the Berg River and thus the hydrological drivers need to be quantified and conceptualised in order to develop salinity management strategies. Various components of the water balance, i.e. precipitation, evaporation, streamflow, recharge, etc., were monitored and quantified. In addition, stable environmental isotopes and water balance modelling were used to perform hydrograph separation as well as to quantify components of the water balance. Annual streamflow in the catchment during the period of observation was variable, ranging between 0.026 mm.a(-1) and 75.401 mm.a(-1). Streamflow volumes also exhibit high variability between water years. Catchment annual rainfall varied between 351 and 655 mm.a(-1), averaging at 473 mm.a(-1). On average, 6.5% of rainfall was converted to streamflow during the period of observation. Evapotranspiration was found to be the dominant component of the water balance, as it comprises, on average, 94% of precipitation in the catchment. Groundwater recharge was calculated to average at 29 mm.a(-1). The water balance model (J2000) performed well during the simulation period with all measures of performance exhibiting acceptable values. Simulation results indicate that streamflow is driven by interflow from the soil horizon (94.68% of streamflow), followed by overland flow (4.92% of streamflow). These results, together with the physiographic conditions evident in the catchment, were used to develop a conceptual flow model. Streamflow is interpreted to be driven by quickflow, i.e. overland flow and interflow, with minimal contribution from groundwater, and is also more dependent on the rainfall distribution in time rather than on the annual volume. The correlation between average annual streamflow and average rainfall was observed to be poor, suggesting that alternative factors, e. g. the spatial distribution of winter wheat, the temporal distribution of rainfall, climatic variables (temperature), etc., exert a greater influence on streamflow. The water balance and conceptual flow model will form the basis for the application of distributed hydrological modelling in the Sandspruit catchment and the development of salinity management strategies. Results from this investigation, e. g. ET estimates, methods to quantify groundwater recharge, hydrograph separation, etc., could potentially be extrapolated to other semi-arid areas.",WATER SA,38,2,,201,212,,10.4314/wsa.v38i2.5,,,,,,0378-4738,,WOS:000306368200005

H.",An Overview of Temporary Stream Hydrology in Canada,"Temporary streams lack streamflow at some time in the seasonal cycle, and include ephemeral, intermittent and episodic streams. They often serve as headwaters for the perennial stream network in a drainage basin, and given that headwater streams can comprise the majority of the drainage network, temporary streams are significant hydrologic features across the country. Nevertheless, they have received relatively little attention compared to perennial streams. In addition, much previous work on temporary streams has focussed on semi-arid and arid landscapes where annual evapotranspiration exceeds annual precipitation. While such climatic conditions do control the occurrence of temporary streams in some regions in Canada, temporary streams can also occur in subhumid and humid climates. This paper examines the major controls on the occurrence and behaviour of temporary streams at the regional and reach scales in Canada; however, where necessary we also review literature from outside Canada on aspects of temporary streams relevant to the Canadian context. The paper assesses the temporal dynamics of temporary streams, along with key aspects of their geomorphology and ecology as well as current monitoring and modelling approaches. Temporary streams are very sensitive to anthropogenic and natural activities that can modify their hydrology and hydroecology, and they deserve greater attention from the Canadian hydrological community.

Sustainable management of river basins demands an assessment of the causes and consequences of human alteration of nutrient flows, together with an evaluation of management options. In the context of an integrated and interdisciplinary environmental assessment (IEA) of nutrient flows, we present and discuss the application of the nutrient emission model MONERIS (MOdelling Nutrient Emissions into River Systems) to the Catalan river basin, La Tordera (north-east Spain), for the period 1996-2002. After a successful calibration and verification process (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies E = 0.85 for phosphorus and E = 0.86 for nitrogen), the application of the model MONERIS proved to be useful in estimating nutrient loads. Crucial for model calibration, in-stream retention was estimated to be about 50% of nutrient emissions on an annual basis. Through this process, we identified the importance of point sources for phosphorus emissions (about 94% for 1996-2002), and diffuse sources, especially inputs via groundwater, for nitrogen emissions (about 31% for 1996-2002). Despite hurdles related to model structure, observed loads, and input data encountered during the modelling process, MONERIS provided a good representation of the major interannual and spatial patterns in nutrient emissions. An analysis of the model uncertainty and sensitivity to input data indicates that the model MONERIS, even in data-starved Mediterranean catchments, may be profitably used by water managers for evaluating quantitative nutrient emission scenarios for the purpose of managing river basins. As an example of scenario modelling, an analysis of the changes in nutrient emissions through two different future scenarios allowed the identification of a set of relevant measures to reduce nutrient loads.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,16,8,,2417,2435,,10.5194/hess-16-2417-2012,,,,,,1027-5606,,WOS:000308245800003

The method has been applied to the pen-urban area of Valencia, extended over the floodplains of the Barranco del Carraixet and Rambla de Poyo catchments. Hazard was assessed using hydrogeomorphological methods. Global exposure was estimated as a combination between the economic value of land use and human exposure, following a previous study carried out by Camarasa, AM., Lopez, M.J. and Soriano, J., 2011.

Synthesis mapping was elaborated to spatially rank flood risks, in terms of their hazard and exposure components. The method is simple, effective and easily comparable. The results reveal diverse risk configurations for each floodplain, even though both are in the vicinity of Valencia city (metropolitan area). This flood risk mapping method is very useful for land use planning because it enables swift diagnosis of the nature of risks and can supports decision making by risk managers and urban planners.

Habitat features and two biodiversity indices (native species richness and diversity) were evaluated at 109 locations. Environmental gradients were assessed using principal component analysis, which orders the habitat variables along two gradients: headwater characteristics and water availability. According to a canonical correspondence analysis, the main environmental factors related to the distribution of species and community structure were, also, climate and headwater habitat features (precipitation, order, channel width, slope and pH), and heterogeneity and trophic features (IHF index and instream macrophytes cover). Relationships between biodiversity indices and environmental variables were best explained by a regression model incorporating, basically, aridity index and precipitation as the variables that accounted for most of the variance.

Streams unaffected by urbanization had intermittent stream flow and completely dry channels for several weeks in autumn and spring. Urbanized streams always possessed channel water, but 2 streams ceased flowing and became stagnant in autumn and spring.

The main objective of this work was to assess the extent of anthropogenic pollution (organotins, faecal indicator bacteria and nutrients) in the river sediment of an intermittent river and its impact on the downstream water bodies: The Vene River, main tributary of the Thau lagoon. We first investigated anthropogenic pollution from water and sediment samples collected in situ along the river course (1.5 km); then, during laboratory experiments, we assessed the survival of faecal bacteria and quantified the degradation rates of organotins on the same sediments.The results indicate the presence of anthropogenic pollution all along the study reach. The waste water treatment plant effluent is a direct pollution input source for anthropogenic pollution. The sediment data points to an urban drainage ditch as a secondary point pollution source while the organotins data highlights the presence of other diffuse sources, specific to this substance. The results of the laboratory experiments show that both faecal bacteria and organotins may persist in the river sediments for up to two months in summer and even longer in winter. This indicates that sediments may, under favourable conditions, become important pollutant stores which may later be released and transported to the Thau lagoon during floods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Vegetation, soils, and water table data were examined to determine potential indicator species of near-surface water that could be used in rapid delineation of Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) by forest managers. Twelve watersheds were instrumented with three hundred screened wells, installed in grids of 25 per sub-watershed. Well locations were used to monitor water table and vegetation communities. Species were classified according to their wetland indicator status for Region 2; communities were evaluated using a prevalence index (PI). As part of a larger study, the uppermost reaches of the headwater systems were treated one of four treatments: (1) removal of all merchantable stems leaving understory intact with minimum surface soil disturbance (BMP1), (2) the same as treatment BMP1 with the addition of logging debris in the drainage channel (BMP2), (3) total harvest with no BMPs applied (clearcut) and (4) no harvest (reference). Post-harvest increases in water table ranged from 1.6 cm in BMP1 to 28.2 cm in clearcut treatments during 2008, from 10.5 cm in BMP1 to 54.2 cm in BMP2 during 2009. PI differed significantly between channel and hillslope positions and represent distinctive vegetation communities. Forest clearcutting affected vegetation communities through combined direct and indirect disturbances. PI in the clearcut did not respond directly to changes in water table. In the two treatments where BMPs were employed, changes in vegetative communities corresponded to both changes in water table and changes in the microclimate as a result of harvesting intensity and changing stand heterogeneity. A vegetative indicator analysis, based on the presence of saturated soil conditions and water table elevation, was used to determine potential indicators of the true hydrologic boundaries of the headwater streams. Three potential indicator species (Viola blanda, Ludwigia glandulosa, and Arundinaria gigantean Ssp. Tecta) were more prevalent within ""wet"" channel positions but exhibited less total frequency of occurrence across the study areas than the fern species Polystichum acrostichoides, which is locally used for rapid estimation of intermittent stream extent).

Secondly, a set of essential parameters has been identified to be estimated or measured under data-poor conditions.

Five flash floods were caused by regional storms and four by local convective storms. The results for the 2010 flash flood show that 90% of the total rainfall volume was lost to infiltration and transmission losses.

We collected dead and living terrestrial invertebrates, aquatic invertebrates, and sestonic matter (i.e., suspended sediments and organic matter) entrained by flow in an AWF travelling downstream over a 7-km-long dry reach. We collected samples at 12 sites along the rewetting reach and at 3 sites in the upstream perennial reach of the Albarine River, France. Invertebrates in the AWF were mainly of terrestrial origin and organic matter was essentially coarse (>5 mm). Terrestrial invertebrate density and taxonomic richness and sestonic matter concentration were several orders of magnitude higher in the AWF than in the perennial reach. However, only terrestrial invertebrate taxonomic richness increased longitudinally. At least 1/3 of terrestrial taxa could have survived submersion, and the density and taxonomic richness of these taxa decreased downstream. These results indicate that terrestrially derived material is stored downstream during rewetting where it could greatly stimulate in-stream aquatic productivity and succession in terrestrial invertebrates along the riparian zone. In contrast, entrained aquatic taxa represented similar to 15% of the benthic taxa collected 1 mo after rewetting, indicating a low contribution of AWFs to benthic invertebrate succession.

Invertebrate,2012,"Datry, Thibault",Benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages along a flow intermittence gradient: effects of duration of dry events,"1. A large proportion of the total river length on Earth comprises rivers that are temporary in nature. However, the effects of periodical dry events have received far less attention from ecologists than those of floods and low flows.2. This study concomitantly examined the effects of flow intermittence on invertebrates from the streambed surface and from a depth of 30 cm in the hyporheic zone. Invertebrates were collected during 3 years in the Albarine River, France, before and after summer dry events from 18 sites (seven were perennial) distributed along a longitudinal flow intermittence gradient.3. I predicted benthic and hyporheic density and taxonomic richness to decrease, and assemblage composition to shift from desiccation-sensitive to desiccation-resistant taxa with increased dry event duration. Second, I predicted benthic and hyporheic assemblages from sites that dried for longer periods to be nested subsets of assemblages from sites that dried for shorter periods. Last, I predicted a convergence in benthic and hyporheic assemblage composition with increasing duration of dry events, resulting from increased vertical migration of benthic taxa into the hyporheic sediments to cope with dry events.4. Increased dry event duration in the Albarine River led to a decrease in both benthic and hyporheic density and taxonomic richness. Invertebrate assemblage composition shifted along the gradient of increasing flow intermittence, but broad taxonomic overlap between perennial and temporary reaches and nestedness patterns indicated that these shifts were because of the loss of taxa susceptible to drying rather than selection for desiccation-resistant specialists.5. Assemblage composition between benthic and hyporheic invertebrates diverged with increasing dry event duration, suggesting that the hyporheic zone did not act as a refuge during dry events in this river.6. Quantitative studies on the relationships between ecology and intermittence are still rare but are needed to predict the consequences of future changes in flow intermittence. The relationships found in this study should be tested across a wide range of temporary rivers to better evaluate the generality of these findings.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,57,3,,563,574,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02725.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000299102000011

In temporary rivers, viewed as coupled terrestrialaquatic ecosystems, spatial and temporal transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial conditions are common and occur simultaneously.2. The effects of artificial rewetting on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate assemblages were examined in dry sediments collected from the Albarine River, France. Rewetted sediments had previously been dry for between 0.1 and 142 days. Dry sediments were collected directly from the streambed (DS) and from riparian gravel bars (RGB).3. We first predicted that invertebrate responses to rewetting would vary with the duration of the preceding dry period. Second, we predicted convergence of the invertebrate assemblages in DS and RGB sediments with increasing duration of the dry period. Third, we predicted that an aquatic 'invertebrate seedbank' (aquatic life stages that persist within streambed sediments during dry periods) would contribute substantially to the resilience of benthic assemblages.4. Results indicated that the duration of the dry period was the primary driver of aquatic and terrestrial responses to artificial rewetting. The density and richness of aquatic taxa decreased with the duration of the dry period in both DS and RGB sediments, whereas the density of terrestrial invertebrates increased in DS sediments.5. No convergence between DS and RGB assemblage composition was observed with an increasing dry period. Although there were more aquatic organisms in DS sediments than in RGB sediments, there was no difference in taxonomic richness between sediment types. Even after prolonged dry periods (142 days), there was typically a lower density and taxonomic richness of terrestrial invertebrates in DS sediments than in adjacent RGB sediments.6. The results suggest that the aquatic invertebrate seedbank could contribute substantially to the resilience of benthic assemblages in the Albarine River, in addition to other mechanisms such as drift and oviposition. Of the taxa in the benthos before and after the summer dry period, 65% were also recovered from artificially rewetted DS sediments. The simultaneous presence of temporal and spatial terrestrial-aquatic transition zones in temporary rivers increases successional diversity (i.e. mosaics of dry and saturated streambed patches at various stages of terrestrial and aquatic succession). This contribution to biodiversity emphasises the need to protect dry reaches of temporary rivers.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,57,4,,716,727,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02737.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000301227000008

Four sediment sampling campaigns were undertaken along the Vene river under different hydrological conditions. Organotin compounds (OTCs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), alkylphenols (APs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediments were analyzed. The results showed that the spatial pattern of contamination by OTCs differed with the hydrological conditions. During high flows, we observed a decrease in OTC concentrations to a background level (from 0.4-24 to 0.4-6.7 ng(Sn)/g dry weight: dw), showing that a large proportion of contaminated sediments were flushed out from the riverbed during the high flow period and transferred to the downstream environment. Concentrations of APs and PCBs were below the limits of quantification in all the sediments analyzed. Unlike OTCs, chemical analyses of PAHs showed that sewage effluents were the major source of contamination as sites located downstream from the discharge of sewage effluents were heavily contaminated (PAH concentrations ranged from 172 to 10,188 ng/g dw). Hydrological conditions also had an impact on the concentrations of PAH, since the highest concentrations (up to 10,188 ng/g dw) were measured downstream from the sewage effluent outlet during the period of high flow, probably due to urban runoff. Particulate transport of OTCs and PAHs after a rainy period was also evaluated using continuous flow centrifugation. High concentrations of OTCs (60.3 ng(Sn)/g dw) and PAHs (4193 ng/g dw) were observed in the exported suspended particulate matter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Like most intermittent rivers in the Mediterranean area, this stream is not well monitored; only few water quality data are available. Thus, due to high variability in streamflow and nutrient concentrations, which characterizes this type of rivers, it is difficult to estimate accurately nutrient loads from point and non point sources and consequently anthropogenic activities impact on the river. In this work, a detailed study was carried out on the Celone river to identify the chemical characteristics of the water and to quantify the annual nutrient loads delivered to the downstream reservoir. An automatic sampler and a flow module were set up in a section of the river. Continuous measures of flow were carried out using a different frequency for water sampling when floods occurred and during normal or low flow state. Nutrient concentrations in the water samples were accurately determined in laboratory. Water quality of the river was found to vary considerably along the year in,terms of nutrient concentration. Nitrate and total phosphorus are the main cause of water pollution. Nutrient losses by surface runoff were essentially a winter process. The contribution per hectare of non point sources can be estimate at about 39 kg/ha of total nitrogen and 2.4 kg/ha of total phosphorus. Estimates of loads in terms of TN and TP for the 21-day period of flood were calculated in 55 and 81% of annual loads, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of flood event contribution to the annual nutrient load.",FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,21,11,SI,3278,3286,,,,,,,,1018-4619,,WOS:000313458700019

M.; Nonner, Johannes C.","Artificial recharge with surface water; a pilot project in Wadi Madoneh, Jordan","Artificial recharge with surface water in Jordan has been discussed at length in several reports and papers, but so far this technique has hardly been applied in the country. This article describes the site selection, design, construction and operation of four small retention structures in Wadi Madoneh during the period 2003-2009. The catchment (37 km(2)) is located some 20 km east of Amman in a desert region (average annual precipitation is 160 mm). The project is based on a feasibility study conducted in the 1990s. It is shown that in the previous study the retention structures have been largely overdesigned, because of absence of discharge measurements and the negligence of climate change. For this pilot an extensive hydrological study was carried out, based on historical data and contemporary measurements, to derive design parameters for small in-channel dams with a height of 3-6 m. The retention structures are designed to retain the floods in order to slowly release this water for infiltration in the Wadi bed downstream. Four retention structures were installed by a local contractor in 2007. This study shows that virtually all surface runoff from the catchment has ceased which makes the method very effective while the costs are low. Artificial recharge with small retention structures is recommended for application on a larger scale and considered a cheap alternative for other non-conventional water resources supply methods. From experience with vandalism and interaction with the local community, improvements to the design of the dams are recommended.",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,65,4,SI,1251,1263,,10.1007/s12665-011-1372-6,,,,,,1866-6280,,WOS:000299840100027
Assessment,2012,"Delgado, Cristina; Pardo, Isabel; Garcia, Liliana","Diatom communities as indicators of ecological status in Mediterranean temporary streams (Balearic Islands, Spain)","Diatoms are widely used for the bioassessment of permanent rivers and streams due to their broad distribution and their ability to integrate changes occurring in water composition and quality, but they have rarely been investigated in temporary streams. Water and epilithic diatom samples were collected from 60 sites in temporary streams distributed among the three largest Balearic Islands (Majorca. Minorca and Ibiza). The sampling design included only temporary streams that have water for at least 4-5 months during the annual period. The selected sites included minimally disturbed (reference sites) and other sites influenced by different degrees of human pressures. Each study site was sampled at least twice in different seasons to take into account the temporal variability in diatom assemblages (n = 255). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analyses of similarities (ANOSIM) were used to assess variation in the communities between a priori defined types and along to the degradation gradient, and to study the species tolerance to pollution. A diatom multimetric index (DIATMIB) was developed to assess the ecological status of temporary streams, as a combination of three metrics: abundance of sensitive taxa, abundance of tolerant taxa and a metric of chlorophyll a values. Individual diatom metrics and the multi metric DIATMIB were correlated in a significant way with phosphate, nitrate, ammonia, silicon dioxide. ash free dry mass and water electric conductivity. Cymbella vulgata, Diploneis oblongella and Encyonopsis microcephala appeared only in reference sites and in high and good status classes. These taxa were replaced by others such as Navicula veneta, Nitzschia inconspicua, N. frustulum and Planothidium frequentissimum that appeared in moderate, poor and bad status classes, which were characterized by high levels of organic/nutrient pollution. Our study validates the application of a diatom multimetric index as a good approach to classify the ecological status of temporary streams due to changes in the structure of diatom communities. We concluded that the multimetric index DIATMIB is a valuable tool for the assessment and future monitoring of temporary Mediterranean streams. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment,2012,"Dodkins, Ian; Aguiar, Francisca; Rivaes, Rui; Albuquerque, Antonio; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Patricia; Ferreira, Maria Teresa",Measuring ecological change of aquatic macrophytes in Mediterranean rivers,"A metric was developed for assessing anthropogenic impacts on aquatic macrophyte ecology by scoring macrophyte species along the main gradient of community change. A measure of ecological quality was then calculated by Weighted Averaging (WA) of these species scores at a monitoring site, and comparison to a reference condition score. This metric was used to illustrate the difficulties of developing aquatic macrophyte indices based on indicator species in Mediterranean rivers. The response of the metric to a nutrient gradient was examined within two different river typologies: the national typology designed for the Water Framework Directive and a typology that segregates the environmental variables to produce maximum species similarity within a river type. Both typologies showed the strong north-south climatic divide in Portugal, with southern rivers having long periods without rainfall and often without flowing water in the summer. Overall, the metric responded well to nutrient impacts however it performed poorly in some southern lowland river types. This was thought to be due to low numbers of aquatic macrophytes in temporary rivers. Non-aquatic species that establish in the river channel of temporary rivers may have to be included in indices to improve performance. Also, simple Weighted Averaging (WA) metrics may be insensitive to abundance changes and loss of rarer indicators in lowland Mediterranean rivers. More sophisticated methods of using WA are suggested, as well as further research into developing assessment methods specific to the character of Mediterranean rivers. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Assessment,2012,"Doell, Petra; Mueller Schmied, Hannes",How is the impact of climate change on river flow regimes related to the impact on mean annual runoff? A global-scale analysis,"To assess the impact of climate change on freshwater resources, change in mean annual runoff (MAR) is only a first indicator. In addition, it is necessary to analyze changes of river flow regimes, i.e. changes in the temporal dynamics of river discharge, as these are important for the well-being of humans (e. g. with respect to water supply) and freshwater-dependent biota (e. g. with respect to habitat availability). Therefore, we investigated, in a global-scale hydrological modeling study, the relation between climate-induced changes of MAR and changes of a number of river flow regime indicators, including mean river discharge, statistical low and high flows, and mean seasonal discharge. In addition, we identified, for the first time at the global scale, where flow regime shifts from perennial to intermittent flow regimes (or vice versa) may occur due to climate change. Climate-induced changes of all considered river flow regime indicators (except seasonal river flow changes) broadly follow the spatial pattern of MAR changes. The differences among the computed changes of MAR due to the application of the two climate models are larger than the differences between the change of MAR and the change of the diverse river flow indicators for one climate model. At the sub-basin and grid cell scales, however, there are significant differences between the changes of MAR, mean annual river discharge, and low and high flows. Low flows are projected to be more than halved by the 2050s in almost twice the area as compared to MAR. Similarly, northern hemisphere summer flows decrease more strongly than MAR. Differences between the high emissions scenario A2 (with emissions of 25 Gt C yr(-1) in the 2050s) and the low emissions scenario B2 (16 Gt C yr(-1)) are generally small as compared to the differences due to the two climate models. The benefits of avoided emissions are, however, significant in those areas where flows are projected to be more than halved due to climate change. If emissions were constrained to the B2 scenario, the area with ecologically relevant flow regime shifts would be reduced to 5.4%-6.7% of the global land area as compared to 6.3%-7.0% in A2. In particular, under the B2 scenario, fewer rivers will change from perennial to intermittent (or transitional) river flows.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,7,1,,,,14037,10.1088/1748-9326/7/1/014037,,,,,,1748-9326,,WOS:000302580600048

We used an integrated habitat-occupancy model to simultaneously quantify habitat change, site fidelity, and local colonization and extinction rates for larvae of a suite of Great Plains stream fishes in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, USA, across three years. Sites were located along a gradient of flow intermittency and groundwater connectivity. Hydrology varied across years: the first and third being relatively wet and the second dry. Despite hydrologic variation, our results indicated that site suitability was random from one year to the next. Occupancy probabilities were also independent of previous habitat and occupancy state for most species, indicating little site fidelity. Climate and groundwater connectivity were important drivers of local extinction and colonization, but the importance of groundwater differed between periods. Across species, site extinction probabilities were highest during the transition from wet to dry conditions (range: 0.52-0.98), and the effect of groundwater was apparent with higher extinction probabilities for sites not fed by groundwater. Colonization probabilities during this period were relatively low for both previously dry sites (range: 0.02-0.38) and previously wet sites (range: 0.02-0.43). In contrast, no sites dried or remained dry during the transition from dry to wet conditions, yielding lower but still substantial extinction probabilities (range: 0.16-0.63) and higher colonization probabilities (range: 0.06-0.86), with little difference among sites with and without groundwater. This approach of jointly modeling both habitat change and species occupancy will likely be useful to incorporate effects of dynamic habitat on metapopulation processes and to better inform appropriate conservation actions.",ECOLOGY,93,4,,858,867,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,WOS:000303650500018

This study aims to describe the spatial distribution of Chironomidae in an intermittent river of semiarid Brazil and to associate assemblage composition with environmental variables. Benthic invertebrates were sampled during the wet and dry seasons using a D-shaped net (40 cm wide and 250 mu m mesh), and the Chironomidae were identified to genus level. The most abundant genera were Tanytarsus, Polypedilum, and Saetheria with important contributions of the genera Procladius, Aedokritus, and Dicrotendipes. Richness and density were not significantly different between the study sites, and multiple regression showed that the variation in richness and density explained by the environmental variables was significant only for substrate composition. The composition of genera showed significant spatial segregation across the study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed significant correspondence between Chironomidae composition and the environmental variables, with submerged vegetation, elevation, and leaf litter being important predictors of the Chironomidae fauna. This study showed that Chironomidae presented important spatial variation along the river and that this variation was substantially explained by environmental variables associated with the habitat structure and river hierarchy.

Dudley",Bacterial community dynamics in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream,"The dynamics of in situ bacterial communities in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream were described in high spatiotemporal detail. We assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial community composition was significantly associated with water intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall, including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19% of identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples, suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid timescales (that is, within days), below-ground and in the hyporheic zone. Owing to the coupling of intermittent streams to the surrounding watershed, we stress the importance of understanding connectivity at the pore scale, consequences for below-ground and above-ground biodiversity and nutrient processing, and across both short- and long-time periods (that is, days to months to years).

Due to increasing water scarcity and unprecedented flood calamities, assessing existing water resources and gathering timely information on water increase are nowadays essential to develop suitable strategies in water resources management. Hydrological models are being studied to increase hydrological process understanding and to support decision making in this field. River basin management models typically operate on wide territories and, given the complexity of most river basins, they are based on semi-empirical lumped parameterizations of hydrological processes. To overcome the uncertainties inherent in such models and achieve acceptable model performance, calibration techniques are indispensable. Remote sensing and satellite-based data with high temporal resolution have the potential to fill such critical information gaps. With its nine spectral bands and very high resolutions (spectral and radiometric) WorldView-2 satellite sensor (WV-2) can provide new insights in the on-going debate comparing object-oriented and spectral-based classifications for the highest accuracy.This paper proposes an efficient object-based method for land cover mapping from Worldview-2 imagery in order to assess its potentiality in acquiring detailed basic information on an ephemeral river area (Lama di Castellaneta, Taranto, Italy), to support further studies in the field of hydrological processes modeling.

The establishment of a cause-effect relationship is hindered in natural systems by the existence of confounding factors (i.e. biotic interactions). Here we analysed the effects that anthropogenic stressors have on a mono-specific fish community (Iberian redfin barbel population, Barbus haasi) inhabiting the northern edge of its distribution range. In Spring 2004, a total of 40 consecutive sampling sites were surveyed in Vallvidrera creek, and 1,331 specimens were measured and weighed. A principal component analysis was performed to synthesize the information provided by 22 environmental variables. Analysis of variance, bivariate correlation analyses and multiple linear regressions were then used to determine the influence of the environmental gradients built (water quality, hydromorphology, woods and macrophytes, and degree of silting) on fish population features (fish size, body condition status, density and biomass). The findings revealed that water quality was the most significant environmental gradient for this fish population. In particular, fish density decreases and fish length increases in those sites exposed to sewage. Additionally, our results showed the best body condition of those specimens inhabiting fast flow reaches which confirms the rheophilous condition of B. haasi. However, these findings were unnoticed for the current version of the index of biotic integrity using fish as bioindicators in Catalonia. Resource managers need to refine diagnostic tools in order to detect subtle deleterious changes on fish communities before they become evident at population scale. Conservation measures should be focused in these small streams in where the best preserved native fish populations usually inhabit.

M.; Froebrich, J.",A novel approach to analysing the regimes of temporary streams in relation to their controls on the composition and structure of aquatic biota,"Temporary streams are those water courses that undergo the recurrent cessation of flow or the complete drying of their channel. The structure and composition of biological communities in temporary stream reaches are strongly dependent on the temporal changes of the aquatic habitats determined by the hydrological conditions. Therefore, the structural and functional characteristics of aquatic fauna to assess the ecological quality of a temporary stream reach cannot be used without taking into account the controls imposed by the hydrological regime. This paper develops methods for analysing temporary streams' aquatic regimes, based on the definition of six aquatic states that summarize the transient sets of mesohabitats occurring on a given reach at a particular moment, depending on the hydrological conditions: Hyperrheic, Eurheic, Oligorheic, Arheic, Hyporheic and Edaphic. When the hydrological conditions lead to a change in the aquatic state, the structure and composition of the aquatic community changes according to the new set of available habitats. We used the water discharge records from gauging stations or simulations with rainfall-runoff models to infer the temporal patterns of occurrence of these states in the Aquatic States Frequency Graph we developed. The visual analysis of this graph is complemented by the development of two metrics which describe the permanence of flow and the seasonal predictability of zero flow periods. Finally, a classification of temporary streams in four aquatic regimes in terms of their influence over the development of aquatic life is updated from the existing classifications, with stream aquatic regimes defined as Permanent, Temporary-pools, Temporary-dry and Episodic. While aquatic regimes describe the long-term overall variability of the hydrological conditions of the river section and have been used for many years by hydrologists and ecologists, aquatic states describe the availability of mesohabitats in given periods that determine the presence of different biotic assemblages. This novel concept links hydrological and ecological conditions in a unique way. All these methods were implemented with data from eight temporary streams around the Mediterranean within the MIRAGE project. Their application was a precondition to assessing the ecological quality of these streams.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,16,9,,3165,3182,,10.5194/hess-16-3165-2012,,,,,,1027-5606,,WOS:000310475400008

T.",Quantifying the effects of stream channels on storm water quality in a semi-arid urban environment,"Stormwater drainage systems can have a large effect on urban runoff quality, but it is unclear how ephemeral urban streams alter runoff hydrochemistry. This problem is particularly relevant in semi-arid regions, where urban storm runoff is considered a renewable water resource. Here we address the question: how do stream channels alter urban runoff hydrochemistry? We collected synoptic stormwater samples during three rainfall-runoff events from nine ephemeral streams reaches (three concrete or metal, three grass, three gravel) in Tucson, Arizona. We identified patterns of temporal and spatial (longitudinal) variability in concentrations of conservative (chloride and isotopes of water) and reactive solutes (inorganic-N, soluble reactive phosphorous, sulfate-S, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen, and fecal indicator bacteria). Water isotopes and chloride (Cl) concentrations indicate that solute flushing and evapoconcentration alter temporal patterns in runoff hydrochemistry, but not spatial hydrochemical responses. Solute concentrations and stream channel solute sourcing and retention during runoff were significantly more variable at the grass reaches (CV = 2.3 - 144%) than at the concrete or metal (CV = 1.6 - 107%) or gravel reaches (CV = 1.9 - 60%), which functioned like flow-through systems. Stream channel soil Cl and DOC decreased following a runoff event (Cl: 12.1-7.3 mu g g(-1) soil; DOC: 87.7-30.1 mu g g(-1) soil), while soil fecal indicator bacteria counts increased (55-215 CFU g(-1) soil). Finding from this study suggest that the characteristics of the ephemeral stream channel substrate control biogeochemical reactions between runoff events, which alter stream channel soil solute stores and the hydrochemistry of subsequent runoff events.

The pattern of meiofaunal assemblages exhibits a high degree of intra-and interannual variability. This pattern alternates between periods of hydrological stability and disturbances, such as floods and droughts, which is a characteristic of Mediterranean systems.3.

Analysis of the study data by means of a nonparametric permutational procedure (PERMANOVA) showed that fertilisation had a significant effect. Density and biomass values increased in the most abundant meiofaunal groups, including microcrustaceans, oligochaetes and chironomids. Microcrustaceans were the dominant group in the permanent meiofauna.4. We also examined differences in microcrustacean secondary production in both reaches. Ostracods and cyclopoid copepods increased their secondary production in the impacted reach as a result of the nutrient addition.5.

Changes in oxygen concentrations and sediment water content influence the biotic processes implicated in nitrogen dynamics. The objectives of this study were to identify (1) the changes of inorganic nitrogen in stream sediments during the transition from wet to dry conditions, and (2) the underlying processes in N dynamics and its regulation. Extractable sediment NO(3) (-)-N and NH(4) (+)-N, organic matter and extractable organic carbon content were assessed during natural desiccation in microcosms with sediments from an intermittent Mediterranean stream. In agreement with our initial hypothesis, our results showed how the NO(3) (-)-N content of the sediment was enhanced during the first 10 days of sediment drying, whereas NH(4) (+)-N was lost by 14 days post-drying. During the first 10 days, sediment desiccation seemed to stimulate the net N-mineralization and net nitrification from sediments. Afterwards, the extractable NO(3) (-)-N concentration sharply dropped, which may be attributed to lower ammonium-oxidation rates as ammonium and organic matter are depleted, and to an increase in NO(3) (-)-N consumption by microbial populations. Denitrification was inhibited, with a significant decrease as % water-filled pore space lowered. We hypothesize that the sediment inorganic N content enhanced during sediment desiccation could be released as part of the N pulse observed after sediment rewetting. However, the stream N availability after rewetting dried sediments would differ depending on desiccation period duration.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,679,1,,43,59,,10.1007/s10750-011-0854-6,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000297620100004

In this sense, naturally stressed ecosystems provide a new framework to test hypotheses in such a context. Here, we use a saline stream (Rambla Salada, SE Spain) as a study case to test the general hypothesis that chronic stress has stronger impacts on metabolism and trophic structure than pulse disturbances. We compared two reaches differing in the persistence of dilution stress over the course of 2 years: the chronically disturbed reach was subject to persistent dilution (chronic disturbance) by freshwater inputs from surrounding irrigated crops and presented a dense stand of the common reed Phragmites australis; and the reference reach, which presented pristine conditions. During the first study year, both reaches were affected by several freshwater inputs due to a diversion channel break (pulse disturbance) that significantly decreased conductivity. During the second year, conductivity recovered to mean pre-pulse disturbance levels. Pulse dilution disturbance had no significant effect on production:respiration ratios (P/R), although predator biomasses increased. However, chronic dilution significantly decreased P/R values as well as consumer and producer biomasses. Dilution disturbances had no significant effects on the relative importance of the different functional feeding groups. Isotopic signatures revealed that macroinvertebrates in both reaches relied upon aquatic autotrophs, despite the common reed inputs at the chronically disturbed reach. In summary, this study highlights the relevance of stress persistence and the usefulness of functional measures when aiming to predict disturbance effects. Thus, whilst pulse disturbances had minor effects on ecosystem function, chronic dilution produced biomass depletion and a change from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic ecosystem.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,686,1,,225,239,,10.1007/s10750-012-1004-5,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000301778600017

L.","Influence of river drying and insect availability on bat activity along the San Pedro River, Arizona (USA)","We evaluated the effects of flow reduction and drying on prey availability and bat activity along a desert river in southeastern Arizona. We sampled bat activity and insect availability during the dry season at perennial and intermittent sites along the San Pedro River. Intermittent sites included both temporally flowing and dry conditions during the study period. Bat activity significantly declined between May and June sampling periods but was not related to whether sites had perennial or intermittent flow. Declines in bat activity corresponded to reductions in insect availability, but only at perennial sites. Bats tracked aquatic insect availability at perennial sites but not at intermittent sites, where insects appear to actively aggregate above localized wet portions of the intermittent reaches. Finally, both bat and insect availability declined to nearly undetected levels when the river dried at 2 of 16 sites in despite increases in terrestrial insect availability. Our results indicate that intermittency affects bat activity indirectly via its effects on prey availability. Seasonal river drying appears to have complex effects on foraging decisions by bats, initially causing imperfect tracking by consumers of localized concentrations of resources, but later resulting in disappearance of both insects and bats after complete drying.

Assessment,2012,"Hagenlocher, Michael; Lang, Stefan; Tiede, Dirk",Integrated assessment of the environmental impact of an IDP camp in Sudan based on very high resolution multi-temporal satellite imagery,"Population displacement due to armed conflicts, regional crises, or natural disasters often leads to large-scale settlements that impact the local environment. The specific dynamics of such semi-permanent settlements, comprising both the structural changes (to the extent of the camp, and the population density), and their wider impacts on the surroundings, require adaptive monitoring capacities. In areas where livelihoods and food security are highly dependent on natural resources, environmental deterioration can result in violent conflicts over access to, or control of, scarce natural resources, or in renewed migration of the population. Remote sensing, and in particular very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, can help determine the actual population dynamics, together with environmental changes in the surrounding areas. In an ex-post assessment using three time slices (2002, 2004, 2008) we assessed the changing environmental conditions and the resulting implications for human security and ecosystem integrity in the vicinity of a large internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in northern Darfur, Sudan. We used a Weighted Natural Resource Depletion index that integrates selected land use/land cover target classes and their relative importance for human security and/or ecosystem integrity by incorporating weightings assigned by experts to each of these classes. The results showed that the dramatic increase in the camp's population between June 2002 and May 2008 (from approximately 1200 to about 50,000 inhabitants) and areal extent (a growth of similar to 436%) was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in the area covered by single shrubs and small trees (similar to -68%), in the area covered by patches of shrubs and trees (similar to-34%), and in the area covered by grassland (similar to -3%). Moreover, a marked expansion in small-scale farming was observed, especially into fertile wadi soils. Almost 45% of all grid cells (60 m x 60 m) had experienced at least some degree of depletion of natural resources (i.e. woody vegetation, grassland, etc.) between 2002 and 2008. Major depletion was observed in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the camp in particular, while minor depletion occurred over almost all of the study area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Biogeochemistry,2012,"Heffernan, James B.; Fisher, Stuart G.",Plant-microbe interactions and nitrogen dynamics during wetland establishment in a desert stream,"In late-successional steady state ecosystems, plants and microbes compete for nutrients and nutrient retention efficiency is expected to decline when inputs exceed biotic demand. In carbon (C)-poor environments typical of early primary succession, nitrogen (N) uptake by C-limited microbes may be limited by inputs of detritus and exudates derived from contemporaneous plant production. If plants are N-limited in these environments, then this differential limitation may lead to positive relationships between N inputs and N retention efficiency. Further, the mechanisms of N removal may vary as a function of inputs if plant-derived C promotes denitrification. These hypotheses were tested using field surveys and greenhouse microcosms simulating the colonization of desert stream channel sediments by herbaceous vegetation. In field surveys of wetland (ci,nega) and gravelbed habitat, plant biomass was positively correlated with nitrate (NO(3) (-)) concentration. Manipulation of NO(3) (-) in flow-through microcosms produced positive relationships among NO(3) (-) supply, plant production, and tissue N content, and a negative relationship with root:shoot ratio. These results are consistent with N limitation of herbaceous vegetation in Sycamore Creek and suggest that N availability may influence transitions between and resilience of wetland and gravelbed stable states in desert streams. Increased biomass in high N treatments resulted in elevated rates of denitrification and shifts from co-limitation by C and NO(3) (-) to limitation by NO(3) (-) alone. Overall NO(3) (-) retention efficiency and the relative importance of denitrification increased with increasing N inputs. Thus the coupling of plant growth and microbial processes in low C environments alters the relationship between N inputs and exports due to increased N removal under high input regimes that exceed assimilative demand.",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,107,41699,,379,391,,10.1007/s10533-010-9559-6,,,,,,0168-2563,,WOS:000298226700023

Relatively little is known about spatial dynamics of unperturbed populations of small-bodied freshwater fish species. This study examined population genetic structure of the purple spotted gudgeon (Mogurnda adspersa, Eleotridae), a small-bodied freshwater fish that is widely distributed in eastern Australia. The species is threatened in parts of its range but is common in coastal streams of central Queensland where this study took place. Microsatellite (msat) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was assessed for nine sites from four stream sections in two drainage basins. Very high levels of among population structure were observed (msat F-ST = 0.18; mtDNA Phi(ST) = 0.85) and evidence for contemporary migration among populations was rare and limited to sites within the same section of stream. Hierarchical structuring of variation was best explained by stream section rather than by drainage basin. Estimates of contemporary effective population size for each site was low (range 28 - 63, Sibship method), but compared favorably with similar estimates for other freshwater fish species, and there was no genetic evidence for inbreeding or recent population bottlenecks. In conclusion, within a stable part of its range, M adspersa exists as a series of small, demographically stable populations that are highly isolated from one another. Complimentary patterns in microsatellites and mtDNA indicate this structuring is the result of long-term processes that have developed over a remarkably small spatial scale. High population structure and limited dispersal mean that recolonisation of locally extinct populations is only likely to occur from closely situated populations within stream sections. Limited potential for recolonisation should be considered as an important factor in conservation and management of this species.",PLOS ONE,7,7,,,,e40546,10.1371/journal.pone.0040546,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000306366400035
Assessment,2012,"Jaeger, K. L.; Olden, J. D.",ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SENSOR ARRAYS AS A MEANS TO QUANTIFY LONGITUDINAL CONNECTIVITY OF RIVERS,"Electrical resistance sensors are used as a novel approach to quantify streamflow continuity (continuous through time) and longitudinal connectivity (continuous through space) across watersheds in south-eastern Arizona, USA. We demonstrate this approach by reporting on a spatial array of 21 sensors installed in streams supporting naturally perennial, intermittent and ephemeral flow on the US Army Garrison, Fort Huachuca. Continuity and connectivity were quantified based on a strict interpretation of continuous flow at an individual sensor (strict continuity) or simultaneous streamflow at multiple sensors (strict connectivity). In addition, we evaluated continuity and connectivity to include periods (<48?h) when in-channel refuges may exist between streamflow events (refuge-maintained continuity and connectivity). Continuous streamflow in intermittent reaches accounted for 34% of the 121-day monitoring period (15 April13 August 2010) and 28% of the summer monsoon period (1 July13 August 2010). Streamflow in ephemeral reaches accounted for 1.5% and 2.3% of the entire monitoring and monsoon period, respectively. Canyon-wide longitudinal connectivity was rare (<1%); however, substantial longitudinal connection occurred along extensive portions of individual canyons. The refuge-maintained criteria increased continuity 28%, with less influence on connectivity (e.g. <3% increase in only some portions of canyons). Despite this result, the refuge-maintained concept remains important because of its broad applicability to refuge persistence across aquatic species and hydro-climatic regimes. The approach presented in this study supports the growing scientific research on the influence of longitudinal hydrologic connectivity on population dynamics and ecological processes in dendritic river networks.

Assessment,2012,"Janisch, Jack E.; Wondzell, Steven M.; Ehinger, William J.","Headwater stream temperature: Interpreting response after logging, with and without riparian buffers, Washington, USA","We examined stream temperature response to forest harvest in small (<9 ha) forested headwater catchments in western Washington, USA over a seven year period (2002-2008). These streams have very low discharge in late summer <(X)over bar> approximate to 0.3 L s(-1)) and many become spatially intermittent. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) study design to contrast the effect of clearcut logging with two riparian buffer designs, a continuous buffer and a patch buffer. We focused on maximum daily temperature throughout July and August, expecting to see large temperature increases in the clearcut streams (n = 5), much smaller increases in the continuously buffered streams (n = 6), with the patch-buffered streams (n = 5) intermediate. Statistical analyses indicated that all treatments resulted in significant (alpha = 0.05) increases in stream temperature. In the first year after logging, daily maximum temperatures during July and August increased in clearcut catchments by an average of 1.5 degrees C (range 0.2 to 3.6 degrees C), in patch-buffered catchments by 0.6 degrees C (range 0.1 to 1.2 degrees C), and in continuously buffered catchments by 1.1 degrees C (range 0.0 to 2.8 degrees C). Temperature responses were highly variable within treatments and, contrary to our expectations, stream temperature increases were small and did not follow expected trends among the treatment types. We conducted further analyses in an attempt to identify variables controlling the magnitude of post-harvest treatment responses. These analyses showed that the amount of canopy cover retained in the riparian buffer was not a strong explanatory variable. Instead, spatially intermittent streams with short surface-flowing extent above the monitoring station and usually characterized by coarse-textured streambed sediment tended to be thermally unresponsive. In contrast, streams with longer surface-flowing extent above the monitoring station and streams with substantial stream-adjacent wetlands, both of which were usually characterized by fine-textured streambed sediment, were thermally responsive. Overall, the area of surface water exposed to the ambient environment seemed to best explain our aggregate results. Results from our study suggest that very small headwater streams may be fundamentally different than many larger streams because factors other than shade from the overstory tree canopy can have sufficient influence on stream energy budgets to strongly moderate stream temperatures even following complete removal of the overstory canopy.

Eight sites were sampled during three different periods of flow. Twenty-five species in eight families, dominated by cichlids and cyprinids, were collected. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to explore the relationship between species and their environmental correlates. According to variation partition, 68.1% of assemblage variation was explained by both habitat and temporal variables. Most species were associated with large pools, whereas small species were associated with habitats that had gravel and boulders. The temporal aspect suggested a pattern associated with high catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the mormyrids, Clarias gariepinus and Labeo altivelis, during the early rain period. By comparison, the late rain period was associated with high CPUE for Labeo cylindricus, Labeobarbus marequensis, Chiloglanis neumanni and Oreochromis mortimeri, whereas the rest of the species had high CPUE during both the late rain and dry periods. The assemblage composition was more diverse during the late rain period. Refuge availability during the dry period appeared to be essential for the assemblage of the intermittent streams. Protection of these temporal habitats is therefore important in conserving fish assemblages within intermittent streams of the Lake Kariba area.",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,50,4,,428,438,,10.1111/j.1365-2028.2012.01338.x,,,,,,0141-6707; 1365-2028,,WOS:000310064900005

We surveyed macroalgal % cover and chl a and physicochemical factors in spring and summer at 15 stream and estuarine sites in a catchment in southern California with a mosaic of undeveloped, agricultural, and urban areas to examine relationships among land use, nutrients, algae, and DO. We used nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) at 12 sites to assess the nutrient(s) limiting algal growth. Algal chl a and pH often exceeded suggested or mandated water-quality impairment thresholds at sites affected by human activity, particularly those downstream from a wastewater treatment plant. Total N (TN) affected total and benthic algal chl a in spring and summer, total P (TP) affected benthic algal chl a in summer, and light influenced algae in summer. N was the sole or primary limiting nutrient at 1/2 of the sites and was colimiting with P at another M of the sites. Nutrient ratios (molar TN: TP) were poor predictors of algal responses to nutrient enrichment. Diel changes in dissolved O-2 were related positively to discharge and negatively to algal chl a, particularly when floating macroalgae were present. In June, N, chl a, and macroalgal % cover were positively related to human landuse patterns at the subcatchment scale, whereas in September, P and chl a were related to landuse patterns at more local scales (500 m, 1000 m).

Carbon and nitrogen are often greater beneath canopies than intercanopies. Upslope vs. downslope position and ephemeral channels might also cause variation in C and N. Yet, few studies have simultaneously evaluated spatial variation associated with canopy-intercanopy patches and topography. We estimated C and N upslope and downslope in an eroding pi lion juniper woodland for canopies beneath pinons (Pinus edulis) and junipers, (Juniperus monosperma), intercanopies, and ephemeral channels. Soil C and N in the surface and profile beneath canopies exceeded that of intercanopies and channels. Relative to intercanopies, channels had more profile C upslope but less downslope (profile N was not significant). Relative to upslope, profile C downslope for intercanopies was greater and for channels was less (profile N was not significant). Relative to profile, surface soil C and N exhibited less heterogeneity. Although some topographic heterogeneity was detected, results did not collectively support our redistribution hypotheses, and we are unable to distinguish if this heterogeneity is due to in situ or redistribution effects. Nonetheless, results highlight finer topographical spatial variation in addition to predominant canopy and intercanopy variation that is applicable for semiarid woodland management.

The effects of hydrological alteration on the structural and functional attributes of riverine communities are expected to be multiple and complex, and they may not be described easily by a single model. Based on existing knowledge of key hydrological and ecological attributes, we explored potential effects of a flow-regulation scenario on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity in two river systems in Australia's relatively undeveloped wet dry tropics. We used a single Bayesian belief network (BBN) to model potential changes in multiple assemblage attribute's within each river type during dry and wet seasons given two flow scenarios: the current, near-natural flow condition, and flow regulation. We then used multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination to visually summarize and compare the most probable attributes of assemblages and their environment under the different scenarios. The flow-regulation scenario provided less certainty in the ecological responses of one river type during the dry season, which reduced the ability to make predictions from the BBN outputs directly. However, visualizing the BBN results in an ordination highlighted similarities and differences between the scenarios that may have been otherwise difficult to ascertain. In particular, the MDS showed that flow regulation would reduce the seasonal differentiation in hydrology and assemblage characteristics that is expected under the current low level of development. Our approach may have wider application in understanding ecosystem responses to different river management practices and should be transferred easily to other ecosystems or biotic assemblages to provide researchers, managers, and decision makers an enhanced understanding of ecological responses to potential anthropogenic disturbance.",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,22,1,,250,263,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,WOS:000301095600019

This study aims to analyze the spatio-temporal variability in the structure of fish communities in an undisturbed and unpolluted Pyrenean river in relation to aquatic habitat features. Fish and habitat were sampled seasonally in 2002 at fourteen sampling sites along the Erro River, a tributary of the Ebro basin (Navarra, northern Spain). Fish communities comprised eight native species, and their capture efficiency estimates were high and consistent along the river. Differences between species in estimated capture probability values were related to attributes such as body size and/or abundance, underscoring the importance of using species-specific capture probabilities. The observed low variability of species capture probabilities allows their use as reference values for future population size estimations based on single-run electrofishing surveys in similarly sized rivers. The longitudinal fish species distribution was analyzed by means of separate hierarchical cluster analyses performed on total species' densities and species' densities partitioned by size-classes, both of which displayed similar patterns of fish community composition along the Erro River. The changes on species presence and relative contributions to local fish communities along the river were also evident from diversity indices, which showed strong and significant positive relationships with distance from the source. Seasonal values in diversity indices were also significantly different within sampling sites, indicating that low-order streams support lower diversity and less-structured fish communities because seasonal flow variations lead to high variability in hydrochemical parameters, habitat size and diversity. Two separate canonical correspondence analyses were performed to jointly summarize the variation in aquatic habitat parameters in relation to fish community size structure in terms of densities or biomasses. In both analyses, the first axis was related to the along-river gradient and the second axis accounted for seasonal variation. The relative positions of fish species along the spatio-temporal gradients are in accordance with their habitat preferences described in the Pyrenean area.

These variations are linked to environmental disturbances, mainly to flow peaks and minimums. From a relatively well structured, but simple, food web at the beginning of the wet period, it can be seen how several trophic levels disappear with time, and how several organisms change or extend their trophic function within it.

Attributes that capture these zero flows could be used to better compare temporary streams with perennial streams from the same area, and contribute to a broader stream classification. This case study of observed variability in flow rates of prairie streams is a step towards the goal of establishing a stream classification system that would be widely useful for practitioners who need to address prediction in ungauged basins in this region. Such a classification system could support inferences that need to be made for streams that are either not currently gauged or for which the period of record is either too short or too discontinuous to allow an understanding of the potential streamflow responses. An approach to streamflow classification that relies solely on hydrometric record may be of particular value for temporary streams that are common in the southern Canadian Prairie Provinces. Similarity of hydrometric station streamflow response within groups is illustrated using both common techniques such cumulative annual and daily mass curve analysis, and a novel streamflow metric, the ratio of the magnitude of the third quartile monthly flow totals to the maximum of the monthly total flow for the period of record is also examined. The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate that by applying conventional analytical techniques in innovative ways the practicing hydrologist can better infer the behavior of streams in areas that are either ungauged, have been gauged only for a short period of time, or are gauged intermittently. While a complete classification system for these streams would include physical, biological, and chemical properties in addition to those that can be determined from hydrometric records, the grouping of hydrologically similar sites is a first step. Such analysis also provides insight into anticipated stream response that will allow for improving design and operation of hydrometric networks.

The materials used to construct the siphon sampler were modified to better adapt the design for the collection of non-conservative water quality parameters and for use in high-intensity flow conditions typical of Australia's dryland rivers. The performance of the siphon sampler was evaluated in a pilot study of water metals in the rising-stage floodwaters of the upper Leichhardt River catchment, north-west Queensland, Australia. Field blanks were used to quantify the extent of contamination of the collected waters by sampling media, atmosphere exposure or water intrusion during an event-based collection period. The use of inert materials, such as high-density polyethylene plastic, and careful cleaning with 10% nitric acid washes prior to use reduced environmental contamination of the collected sample. Below detectable levels of Pb and Zn and minor concentrations of Cu (1.8 and 1.3 mu g L1) were reported in rinsate and atmospheric blanks that were exposed in the field for less than 24 h. Atmospheric and flood blanks that remained in the field for greater than 2 weeks and remained in the siphon samplers throughout the duration of the flood events reported quantifiable concentrations of metals. For the case of the upper Leichhardt River catchment, the siphon sampler met the need of providing event-based water collection data and offered a practical, low-cost alternative to conventional event-based sampling techniques.

Ribeira da Agua Forte is a stream that drains the area of the old mine dumps of the Aljustrel mine, which have for decades been a source of acid waters. This stream flows to the north for a little over than 10 km, but mixes with a reduced, organic-rich, high pH waste water from the municipal waste water pools of the village. This water input produces two different results in the chemistry of the stream depending upon the season: (i) in the winter season, effective water mixing takes place, and the flux of acid water from the mine dumps is continuous, resulting in the immediate precipitation of the Fe from the acid waters; (ii) during the summer season, acid drainage is interrupted and only the waste water feeds the stream, resulting in the reductive dissolution of Fe hydroxides and hydroxysulfates in the stream sediments, releasing significant quantities of metals into solution. Throughout the year, water pH stays invariably within 4.0-4.5 for several meters downstream of this mixing zone even when the source waters come from the waste water pools, which have a pH around 8.4. The coupled interplay of dissolution and precipitation of the secondary minerals (hydroxides and sulfates), keeps the system pH between 3.9 and 4.5 all along the stream. In particular, evidence suggests that schwertmannite may be precipitating and later decomposing into Fe hydroxides to sustain the stream water pH at those levels. While Fe content decreases by 50% from solution, the most important trace metals are only slightly attenuated before the solution mixes with the Ribeira do Roxo stream waters. Concentrations of As are the only ones effectively reduced along the flow path. Partitioning of Cu, Zn and Pb in the contaminated sediments also showed different behavior. Specific/non-specific adsorption is relevant for Cu and Zn in the upstream branch of Ribeira da Agua Forte with acid drainage conditions, whereas the mixture with the waste water causes that the association of these metals with oxyhydroxide to be more important. Metals bound to oxyhydroxides are on the order of 60-70% for Pb, 50% for Cu and 30-60% for Zn. Organic matter is only marginally important around the waste water input area showing 2-8% Cu bound to this phase. These results also show that, although the mixing process of both acid and organic-rich waters can suppress and briefly mitigate some adverse effects of acid drainage, the continuing discharge of these waste waters into a dry stream promotes the remobilization of metals fixed in the secondary solid phases in the stream bed back into solution, a situation that can hardly be amended back to its original state.

Assessment,2012,"Mararakanye, N.; Le Roux, J. J.",Gully location mapping at a national scale for South Africa,"Gully erosion is an important form of soil erosion that contributes greatly to soil degradation and loss in South Africa (SA). It is a process whereby soil is removed through the concentration of surface or subsurface water which results into the formation of incised channels. However, little is known regarding the spatial extent of gullies in SA, especially at a national scale. Previous soil erosion assessment studies indicated the difficulties of modelling or automatically extracting gullies using remote sensing at regional scales due to the temporal and spatial complexity at which the phenomenon occurs. This study created a gully location map for SA by means of visual interpretation and vectorisation from Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 imagery at a scale of 1:10,000 within a geographic information system. Results illustrate the extent of gully erosion in the Eastern Cape (161,517 ha), Northern Cape (160,885 ha), KwaZulu-Natal (92,543 ha), Free State (64,674 ha), Limpopo (58,669 ha), Western Cape (25,403 ha), Mpumalanga (17,420 ha) and North West (10,782 ha) provinces. Additional zonal calculations indicate that gullies are more prominent on land that is suitable for cultivation (4.3%) than on less suitable to unsuitable land (1.5%), subsequently undermining sustainable management of soil resources and food security. This is probably attributed to inappropriate agricultural activities such as clearing of vegetation and overstocking in certain agricultural areas. Despite some problems experienced during the interpretation and mapping phases (such as difficult distinction between gullies and dry river beds/channels, landslides and other erosion forms), results show an overall accuracy of 90% when compared to observations (n = 1019) in the field. Future studies should focus on quantifying different contributing factors in order to ease selection of appropriate management strategies.",SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL,94,2,,208,218,,10.1080/03736245.2012.742786,,,,,,0373-6245,,WOS:000312696200008
Assessment,2012,"Martinez Ibarra, E.",A geographical approach to post-flood analysis: The extreme flood event of 12 October 2007 in Calpe (Spain),"The study demonstrates the importance, in general, of adopting a geographical (integral) approach and local analysis to determine flood risk in small Mediterranean basins, where normally there is no surface runoff. At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the tourist town of Calpe (Alicante, Spain) on 12 October 2007.Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by small basins in the Mediterranean following intense rainfall events that may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here, we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of 500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations that have taken place along the Mediterranean coast. The expansion of urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The municipal area recognised as presenting a class ""2"" qualitative vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable) rose from 1% to 34% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to just 0.7 ha in 2002.The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins. It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations required.

An abiotic typology was set by the Portuguese Water Agency, mainly based on 6 major morphoclimatic regions. However, to be biologically meaningful, this typology should fit the distribution patterns of the biological quality elements communities proposed in Water Framework Directive under the lowest possible human pressure. This study aimed to identify and characterize fish-based geographical groups for continental Portugal and their environmental and geographical discriptors, using taxonomic and functional traits. Sampling took place between 2004 and 2006 during Spring. Fish fauna from 155 reference sites was analysed using a multivariate approach. Cluster Analysis on fish composition identified 10 fish-groups, expressing a clear correspondence to the river basin level, due to the restrict basin distribution of many species. Groups showed a wider aggregation in 4 regions with a larger geographical correspondence, statistically supported by Similarity Analysis, both on fish composition and mostly on fish metrics/guilds. Principal Components Analysis revealed major environmental drivers associated to fish-groups and fish-regions. Fish-groups were hierarchically grouped over major and local regions, expressing a large-scale response to a North-South environmental gradient defined by temperature, precipitation, mineralization and altitude, and a regional scale response mainly to drainage area and flow discharge. From North to South, fish-regions were related to the morphoclimatic regions.

"Fish, Assessment",2012,"Matono, Paula; Bernardo, Joao M.; Oberdorff, Thierry; Ilheu, Maria",Effects of natural hydrological variability on fish assemblages in small Mediterranean streams: Implications for ecological assessment,"Small Mediterranean streams are shaped by predictable seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle, and present a strong inter and intra-annual variation in flow regime. Native fish assemblages in these streams are adapted to this natural environmental variability. The distinction of human-induced disturbances from the natural ones is thus a crucial step before assessing the ecological status of these streams. In this aim, the present study evaluates the effects of natural hydrological variability on fish assemblages from disturbed and least disturbed sites in small intermittent streams of south Portugal. Data were collected over the last two decades (1996-2011) in 14 sites located in the Guadiana and Sado river basins. High variability of fish assemblages was strongly dependent on human-induced disturbances, particularly nutrient/organic load and sediment load, and on natural hydrological variability. Natural hydrological variability can act jointly with anthropogenic disturbances, producing changes on fish assemblages structure of small intermittent streams. In least disturbed sites, despite the natural disturbances caused by inter-annual rainfall variations (including drought and flood events), fish assemblages maintained a long-term stability and revealed a high resilience. On the contrary, disturbed sites presented significantly higher variability on fish assemblages and a short and long-term instability, reflecting a decrease on the resistance and resilience of fish assemblages. Under these conditions, fish fauna integrity is particularly vulnerable and the ecological assessment may be influenced by natural hydrological variations. High hydrological variability (especially if it entails high frequency of dryer years and meaningful cumulative water deficit) may affect the impact of the human pressures with significant and consistent consequences on fish assemblage composition and integrity. In this study, fish metrics that maximize the detection of human degradation and minimize the response to natural variability were based on the relative abundance of native species (insectivorous species, eurytopic species, water column species, native lithophilic species), relative abundance of species with intermediate tolerance and relative number of exotic species. Results highlight the importance of assessing temporal variability on stream biomonitoring programs and emphasize the need to improve the assessment tools, accounting for long-term changes in fish assemblages, namely by selecting the most appropriate fish metrics that respond to anthropogenic disturbances but exhibit low natural temporal variability, essential both in the characterization of the biological reference conditions and in the development of fish indexes in intermittent streams.

"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2012,"Medici, C.; Wade, A. J.; Frances, F.",Does increased hydrochemical model complexity decrease robustness?,"The aim of this study was, within a sensitivity analysis framework, to determine if additional model complexity gives a better capability to model the hydrology and nitrogen dynamics of a small Mediterranean forested catchment or if the additional parameters cause over-fitting. Three nitrogen-models of varying hydrological complexity were considered. For each model, general sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) were applied, each based on 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results highlighted the most complex structure as the most appropriate, providing the best representation of the non-linear patterns observed in the flow and streamwater nitrate concentrations between 1999 and 2002. Its 5% and 95% GLUE bounds, obtained considering a multi-objective approach, provide the narrowest band for streamwater nitrogen, which suggests increased model robustness, though all models exhibit periods of inconsistent good and poor fits between simulated outcomes and observed data. The results confirm the importance of the riparian zone in controlling the short-term (daily) streamwater nitrogen dynamics in this catchment but not the overall flux of nitrogen from the catchment. It was also shown that as the complexity of a hydrological model increases over-parameterisation occurs, but the converse is true for a water quality model where additional process representation leads to additional acceptable model simulations. Water quality data help constrain the hydrological representation in process-based models. Increased complexity was justifiable for modelling river-system hydrochemistry.

Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) is an exotic tree invading riparian corridors in the western United States, and may alter stream organic matter budgets by increasing allochthonous litter and by reducing light via shading, in turn decreasing in-stream primary production. We used a before-after invasion comparison spanning 35 years to show that Russian olive invasion increased allochthonous litter nearly 25-fold to an invaded vs. a control reach of a stream, and we found that this litter decayed more slowly than native willow. Despite a mean 50% increase in canopy cover by Russian olive and associated shading, there were no significant changes in gross primary production. Benthic organic matter storage increased fourfold after Russian olive invasion compared to pre-invasion conditions, but there were no associated changes in stream ecosystem respiration or organic matter export. Thus, estimated stream ecosystem efficiency (ratio of ecosystem respiration to organic matter input) decreased 14%. These findings show that invasions of nonnative plant species in terrestrial habitats can alter resource fluxes to streams with consequences for whole-ecosystem functions.",ECOLOGY,93,7,,1501,1508,,,,,,,,0012-9658; 1939-9170,,WOS:000306829300001

Wadi aquifers contain a high percentage of the naturally occurring fresh groundwater in the Kingdom. This resource is currently overused and has become depleted or contaminated at many locations. One resource that could be used to restore or enhance the fresh water resources within wadi aquifers is treated municipal waste water (reclaimed water). Each year about 80 percent of the country's treated municipal waste water is discharged to waste without any beneficial use. These discharges not only represent a lost water resource, but also create a number of adverse environmental impacts, such as damage to sensitive nearshore marine environments and creation of high-salinity interior surface water areas. An investigation of the hydrogeology of wadi aquifers in Saudi Arabia revealed that these aquifers can be used to develop aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR) systems that will be able to treat the impaired-quality water, store it until needed, and allow recovery of the water for transmittal to areas in demand. Full-engineered ARR systems can be designed at high capacities within wadi aquifer systems that can operate in concert with the natural role of wadis, while providing the required functions of additional treatment, storage and recovery of reclaimed water, while reducing the need to develop additional, energy-intensive desalination to meet new water supply demands.",GROUND WATER,50,4,,514,527,,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00941.x,,,,,,0017-467X,,WOS:000305906900008

The degree of contamination was evaluated using the sediment pollution index (SPI) and enrichment factor. The concentrations of As, Cd, Se, and Zn in the contaminated sediments were elevated due to anthropogenic activities. According to the SPI, surface sediments in the ephemeral rivers flowing in the vicinity of the Sungun porphyry copper deposit are classified as natural sediment with no ecological risk, while sediments that received contaminated effluents are classified as slightly polluted. Sequential extraction indicated that Co was principally associated with the iron and manganese oxide fraction, while other elements (As, Zn, Cr, Se, and Ni) were mainly distributed in residual phases. Cadmium is the only element that has a high potential for mobility and bioavailability in the sediments and, of the investigated elements, it poses the greatest potential risk to the local aquatic ecosystems. The chemical fractionation pattern of elements appears to be influenced by industrial effluents.

We investigated in this study the degree to which large-scale features of the watersheds and reach-scale habitats correlated with a non-random structure of fish species' richness, composition and distribution under these conditions by intensively sampling a river system during summer and using Geographical Information Systems data. The results of multivariate ordination and association analyses showed that multi-scale factors were hierarchically related and that they correlated with non-random fish distributions and assemblage structure. They also highlighted large-scale factors shaping reach-scale water availability for fish during summer. Fish species' richness, composition and distribution varied along a gradient of water shortage and connectivity loss which were more severe with the smaller drainage area into the reaches upstream. Fish species' distributions along these gradients were strongly correlated with both life-history traits (adult size) and biogeographical origin (native vs. exotic). The results for the summer environmental segregation of exotic versus small endemic richness characteristics indicate strong species' interactions forcing the latter into the upstream, harsher seasonal habitats. Special fitness costs are to be expected in drought years, in regulated rivers, and in general, in a climate change scenario in Mediterranean river networks. The study emphasizes that the conservation of the threatened Mediterranean freshwater fish faunas requires operating at the proper spatial scale.

Five main palaeoenvironmental categories are represented: (1) perennial rivers, (2) ephemeral rivers, (3) floodplain lakes, (4) alluvial fan, and (5) marginal marine. Ichnocoenoses mainly reflect the activity of aquatic and/or semi-aquatic animals. Fluvial deposits preserve evidence for colonisation by eurypterids, fish and myriapods. Ephemeral river channel margins/splays preserve the most diverse ichnofauna composed of deposit feeders' burrows and trackways produced by arthropods feeding and foraging in channel-margin soft grounds that were colonised after fluvial flood events. High densities of deposit-feeding structures may indicate of explosive population growth in response to periodic, acyclical replenishment of nutrients in these aquatic settings. Ichnotaxa common to both perennial and ephemeral fluvial environments suggest that there might have been only one aquatic ecosystem. The degree to which the channel-margin ichnofaunas record a truly subaerial terrestrial arthropod signature is difficult to ascertain and most trace makers were probably semi-aquatic. Some terrestrial animals invaded channel-margin areas to feed and were also capable of inhabiting high-energy, alluvial fan environments. However the fans contain low diversity ichnological assemblages and were likely to have been inhabited by an opportunistic fauna. Possibly the only truly subaerial terrestrial ichnocoenosis is that of pedogenically modified mudrock with Scoyenia, which represents an early soil ichnofauna. The majority of ichnocoenoses described from continental palaeoenvironments could be classified under the Scoyenia ichnofacies.

The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

M.",The ecology of pulse events: insights from an extreme climatic event in a polar desert ecosystem,"Climate change is occurring globally, with wide ranging impacts on organisms and ecosystems alike. While most studies focus on increases in mean temperatures and changes in precipitation, there is growing evidence that an increase in extreme events may be particularly important to altering ecosystem structure and function. During extreme events organisms encounter environmental conditions well beyond the range normally experienced. Such conditions may cause rapid changes in community composition and ecosystem states. We present the impact of an extreme pulse event ( a flood) on soil communities in an Antarctic polar desert. Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, is dominated by large expanses of dry, saline soils. During the austral summer, melting of glaciers, snow patches and subsurface ice supplies water to ephemeral streams and wetlands. We show how the activation of a non-annual ephemeral stream, Wormherder Creek, and the associated wetland during an exceptional high-flow event alters soil properties and communities. The flow of water increased soil water availability and decreased salinity within the wetted zone compared with the surrounding dry soils. We propose that periodic leaching of salts from flooding reduces soil osmotic stress to levels that are more favorable for soil organisms, improving the habitat suitability, which has a strong positive effect on soil animal abundance and diversity. Moreover, we found that communities differentiated along a soil moisture gradient and that overland water flow created greater connectivity within the landscape, and is expected to promote soil faunal dispersal. Thus, floods can 'precondition' soils to support belowground communities by creating conditions below or above key environmental thresholds. We conclude that pulse events can have significant long-term impacts on soil habitat suitability, and knowledge of pulse events is essential for understanding the present distribution and functioning of communities in soil ecosystems.",ECOSPHERE,3,2,,,,UNSP 17,10.1890/ES11-00325.1,,,,,,2150-8925,,WOS:000327299100005

Aquatic beetles were collected between November 2009 and May 2010 from three intermittent sites along the Rimanio stream at different distances from the perennial part (DP), using quantitative sampling methods.

We examined the effects of leaf litter quality (e. g., leaf nutrients, lignin and cellulose content), leaf species mixing, and microbial community diversity on in-stream breakdown rates of litter from dominant riparian trees (Melaleuca argentea, M. leucadendra, and Nauclea orientalis) in both a perennial and intermittent river in Australia's wet-dry tropics. Leaf mass remaining after 82 days of in-stream incubation was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with initial leaf N and P content while initial lignin and cellulose content had no statistically significant effect. Breakdown rates of incubated leaves of both Melaleuca and Nauclea were significantly higher in mixed litter bags compared with single species litter bags. Although it was expected that leaf N content would decrease from initial levels during decomposition, we found either similar or slightly higher N content following in-stream incubation suggesting microbial colonisation increased overall N content. Stable isotopes of delta C-13 and delta N-15 for the major sources and consumers in both rivers provide evidence that leaf litter was an important macroinvertebrate food source in the perennial river where heavy shading may limit algal production. However, in the intermittent river where riparian cover was low, benthic algae were the major organic carbon source for consumers. Our findings suggest that riparian tree species influence rates of in-stream organic matter processing, microbial community composition, and aquatic food web dynamics in tropical wet-dry streams.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,680,1,,63,77,,10.1007/s10750-011-0903-1,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000298809300006

Since amphibians are highly sensitive to moisture changes, amphibian assemblages were used as a monitoring parameter to evaluate the effects of check dams on biotic components in this study. Comparison of amphibian assemblages between check dam and non-check dam areas was conducted along ephemeral streams in a tropical deciduous forest of the Chulalongkorn University Forest and Research Station in Nan Province, Thailand from April 2009 to March 2010. Five transects, including the stream transect, and 5; 10, 25, and 50 m terrestrial transects, were used for amphibian surveys between the two areas. Physical factors related to moisture were also compared between these areas. It was found that hydroperiod in the check darn stream was significantly higher than that in the non-check dam stream. Soil moisture content at most terrestrial transects in the check darn area was significantly higher than that in the non-check dam area, while similarity in leaf litter moisture content was found in most transects. Simpson's index of diversity indicated that amphibian diversities in all transects were equally diverse between the two areas in both wet and dry seasons. Cluster analysis of similarity in species composition indicated that amphibian composition in the check darn stream was distinct from that in the non-check darn stream in the wet season or the functional period of the check darn. However, the amphibian compositions in both check darn and non-check dam streams were similar to each other in the dry season. No significant check darn effect was found on species composition in the terrestrial habitats in both seasons. Overall, using a highly moisture-sensitive vertebrate as a bio-indicator, the results showed that the check darns and the changes in moisture-related physical factors appear to have little short-term effect on amphibian assemblages.",ASIAN HERPETOLOGICAL RESEARCH,3,3,,175,183,,10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00175,,,,,,2095-0357,,WOS:000310663800001

We investigated the importance of nutrients and light availability on the structure and the function of epilithic biofilms in a Mediterranean forested stream (Fuirosos, Spain). Biofilms grew on artificial substrata in both enriched and unenriched reaches where shade conditions were simulated. Four different treatments were generated: higher light unenriched, lower light unenriched, higher light enriched (HL-E) and lower light enriched. Chlorophyll a, bacterial density, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), extracellular leucine aminopeptidase (LAmP) and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activities were analysed during the colonisation at days 4, 9, 16, 22 and 52. At day 52, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to determine differences in biofilm architecture. CLSM evidenced differences in thickness and structural complexity of biofilms grown in different conditions. Biofilms in HL-E were the thickest and had the most complex structure. The CLSM highlighted that the EPS was agglomerated in the upper layer of enriched-grown biofilms, but evenly distributed through the biofilm in unenriched biofilms. CLSM 3D images suggested that cyanobacteria increased under higher nutrient conditions. Nutrient enrichment caused the decrease of APase activity. Interaction between the two factors affected LAmP activity. HL-E had the highest LAmP and the lowest APase activities, an indication that biofilm responses to nutrients mostly occurred with high-light availability.

Fish,2012,"Reid, M. A.; Delong, M. D.; Thoms, M. C.",THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY ON FOOD WEB STRUCTURE IN FLOODPLAIN LAKES,"Hydrological connectivity is an important driver of ecosystem structure in floodplain rivers; however, little is known of how hydrological connectivity affects the structure and functioning of food webs in these systems. This study examines aquatic food web structure in 10 floodplain lakes on a dryland river floodplain in eastern Australia across a connectivity gradient. Results for fishes suggest that benthic carbon sources are more important in high connectivity billabongs than in low connectivity billabongs and that pelagic sources are more important in low connectivity billabongs than in high connectivity billabongs. Fishes in less connected billabongs were also found to feed at higher trophic levels than in more connected billabongs. We hypothesize that in high connectivity billabongs, where suitable benthic primary sources are abundant, common fish species such as carp and bony bream feed as detritivores or herbivores; while in low connectivity billabongs, where benthic sources are less abundant, the same species feed as planktivores, insectivores or piscivores. This dietary difference may also be promoted by greater predation efficiency in less structurally complex low connectivity billabongs. The feeding behaviour of these fish species subsequently influences the trophic positions of fishes higher in the food chain and ultimately the total food chain lengths that high and low connectivity billabongs support. The results of this study highlight the importance of hydrological connectivity to the structure of food webs in these systems and the potential for them to be affected by water resource development.

A.",Influence of flow variability on macroinvertebrate assemblages in an intermittent stream of semi-arid Brazil,"This study aims to evaluate the effects of variable water flow on macroinvertebrate composition and taxon richness in a semi-arid intermittent stream. Chironomid larvae were the most abundant group of insects in the intermittent stream studied. Nevertheless, their response to flow was similar to the macroinvertebrate fauna as a whole. Macroinvertebrates were more abundant in the late wet phase and in the drying phase. A higher richness was also observed during this period, when new taxa where registered. Discharge, temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen were the main variables explaining the variation in richness and density of macroinvertebrate. These variables were also important in explaining the variation in community composition through time. It is suggested that invertebrates cope with the extreme intermittent flows by resilience during variable flows in the wet phase and by resistance during the dry phase. It is however important to notice that frequently high discharges drive the community to lower richness and densities, whereas the resistance during the dry phase is characterized by a taxonomic shift resultant from the survival of the few taxa that supports the initial desiccation and the opportunism of colonizing predaceous taxa overcoming non-resistant taxa.

Although the effects of flow regulation have been relatively well studied, a lack of synthesis of the ecological consequences of low flows and droughts impedes research progress and our grasp of the mechanistic effects of human-induced water reductions on riverine ecosystems. We identified 6 ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow (antecedent conditions, duration, magnitude, timing and seasonality, rate of change, and frequency) that act within the temporal hierarchy of the flow regime and a spatial context. We synthesized the literature to propose 4 principles that outline the mechanistic links between these low-flow attributes and the processes and patterns within riverine ecosystems. First, low flows control the extent of physical aquatic habitat, thereby affecting the composition of biota, trophic structure, and carrying capacity. Second, low flows mediate changes in habitat conditions and water quality, which in turn, drive patterns of distribution and recruitment of biota. Third, low flows affect sources and exchange of material and energy in riverine ecosystems, thereby affecting ecosystem production and biotic composition. Last, low flows restrict connectivity and diversity of habitat, thereby increasing the importance of refugia and driving multiscale patterns in biotic diversity. These principles do not operate in isolation, and many of the ecological pathways that are affected by low flows are likely to overlap or occur simultaneously, potentially resulting in synergistic and complex effects. Last, we outlined major human-induced threats to low-flow hydrology and how they act upon the ecologically relevant hydrological attributes of low flow to affect potential changes in riverine ecosystem integrity. The mechanistic links described in this synthesis can be used to develop and test hypotheses of low-flow hydrological ecological response relationships in a cause effect framework that will have value for both research and river flow management.

Analysis focused on a suite of food web properties that describe species' trophic habits, linkage complexity and food chains. A great structural similarity was found in analyzed food webs; we therefore suggest average values for the structural properties of Mediterranean stream food webs.

In short, our results suggest that omnivory and the weak interactions of detritivores have a stabilizing role in these food webs.",AQUATIC ECOLOGY,46,3,,311,324,,10.1007/s10452-012-9400-5,,,,,,1386-2588,,WOS:000306849300004

In each stream, we created three different variations of the original food web, according to the trophic species aggregation applied. The aggregations used here were based on predator-prey relationships, i.e., species were lumped at different levels of trophic habits in the food web into top (T), intermediate (I) and basal (B) species. In our studied food webs, these species corresponded to fishes, macroinvertebrates and different types of detritus, respectively. No significant differences were found in structural properties when we analyzed the stream effect, but these were found in the analysis of aggregation variation effect. Species grouping, and the level within the food web at which it occurs, influenced the structural properties of the food web. However, these properties were comparable between all the studied streams when the same resolution was considered. The relationship between omnivory and connectance was not affected by trophic species grouping. These properties were positively and significantly related in all aggregation variations of the food webs, suggesting that the stabilizing role of omnivory is maintained regardless of the particular grouping method utilized.",APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,10,3,,333,347,,,,,,,,1589-1623,,WOS:000313421600009

This directive emphasises that natural variability of quality elements in high status (reference condition) needs to be quantified. Mediterranean streams often present a marked seasonal pattern in hydrological, biological and geochemical processes which could affect physico-chemical reference conditions. This study establishes general physico-chemical reference conditions (oxygenation, nutrient, salinity and acidification conditions) for different Mediterranean stream types. 116 potential reference sites located in 23 Mediterranean catchments in Spain were sampled in spring, summer and autumn in 2003. All sites were subjected to a screening method for the selection of reference sites in Mediterranean streams (Mediterranean Reference Criteria) and classified using a pre-established stream typology that establishes five different stream types (temporary streams, evaporite-calcareous at medium altitude, siliceous headwaters, calcareous headwaters and large watercourses). Reference conditions (reference value and reference threshold equivalents to high-good class boundary) were calculated using two different methods according to the availability of reference sites: the reference site 75th percentile approach of all reference sites and the 25th percentile of the population approach. The majority of the studied potential reference sites (76 out of 116) were selected as reference sites. Regarding type-specific reference conditions, only siliceous headwaters could be considered different from the rest of stream types because lower conductivity and pH. All reference stream types presented seasonal differences as regards some parameters, except for temporary streams due to the high natural variation of this stream type. For those parameters which presented seasonal differences in a specific stream type, the least restrictive values were proposed as reference conditions.",Water research,46,7,,2257,69,,10.1016/j.watres.2012.01.042,,,,,,1879-2448,,MEDLINE:22386888

On the basis of the depletion of a groundwater-fed stream, three study sites corresponding to interrupted, intermittent and permanent streams were selected throughout the ecotone in the Sunsunes catchment (Orinoco basin, Venezuela). To describe the human impact on land cover, patchiness, biodiversity, hydrological and edaphic features, NPP and nutrient availability, we use structural and functional approaches. Hydrological (i.e., duration of inundation and maximum inundation height), soil chemical (e.g., Ca concentration, available phosphorous, soil organic matter) and physical (i.e., water-filled pore spaces) features were the best predictors of anthropogenic disturbance. In the ecotone, the tree species invasion from well-drained savannas increased woody cover as described by a stretched exponential model. Groundwater drawdown in the interrupted and intermittent streams increased with 74 and 34 colonizer species from well-drained savannas. The NPP of the ecotonal vegetation along the interrupted stream (909 g C/m(2)/yr) was a higher sink as compared to the intermittent and permanent streams (580 g C/m(2)/yr). Anthropogenic stress along with natural disturbance resulted in a decline in the systemA ' s functioning. In contrast to hydrology, the effect of the nutrient addition (i.e., liming and phosphorous) on the carbon accumulation by species was not significant. Therefore, the functional response of the system was more sensitive to hydrology regime.

The exotic annual grass Microstegium vimineum often occurs in the greatest density along disturbed corridors, such as waterways and trails, within otherwise undisturbed forests. We tested the hypothesis that such linear features within forests are correlated with invasion patterns. We surveyed linear transects along intermittent streams and foot trails through eight upland forests of different ages, as well as control transects within each forest that were distant from any type of linear feature. We documented significantly larger and denser patches of M. vimineum along transects in young forests than those in old stands. Streams and trails were similarly more invaded than control transects, and M. vimineum was distributed much more patchily away from such corridors. Isolated individual patches of M. vimineum (along neither streams nor trails) demonstrated the potential to expand at approximately 1 m over 1 y, although 11% of plants appeared farther than 2 m from their parent patch. Although germinants appeared downslope of the parent patch two to four times more frequently than upslope, the mean distance of spread was equivalent in both directions.

The aquifer storativity and transmissivity estimations from a set of wells provide spatial variability feature that can be captured by probability and statistical methodologies leading to risk assessment. Three methodologies are employed for the uncertainty assessments in this paper. The heterogeneity can be treated either through deterministic formulations by a set of assumptions or by statistical and probabilistic approaches giving way to risk assessments. They are the classical deterministic approach, statistical procedure that takes into consideration arithmetic average, standard deviation and correlation coefficient of hydrogeological variables and finally the probabilistic method with risk attachments. The first approach depends on the constant aquifer parameters or their arithmetic averages only. The second procedure considers the deviations (perturbations) from the arithmetic average and then various statistical parameters enter into the calculations.

We expected that body condition (as measured by whole body lipid content) and biomass of M. ambigua would be related to prey biomass, and that these factors would all 'spike' following widespread flooding. Instead we found more subtle responses. There were 'booms' in biomass of Macrobrachium and zooplankton, two important food items, whereas M. ambigua maintained relatively low but sustained lipid and biomass levels following flooding.

F.",Legacies of flood reduction on a Dryland river,"The Bill Williams (Arizona) is a regulated dryland river that is being managed, in part, for biodiversity via flow management. To inform management, we contrasted riparian plant communities between the Bill Williams and an upstream free-flowing tributary (Santa Maria). Goals of a first study (19961997) were to identify environmental controls on herbaceous species richness and compare richness among forest types. Analyses revealed that herbaceous species richness was negatively related to woody stem density, basal area and litter cover and positively related to light levels. Introduced Tamarix spp. was more frequent at the Bill Williams, but all three main forest types (Tamarix, Salix/Populus, Prosopis) had low understory richness, as well as high stem density and low light, on the Bill Williams as compared to the Santa Maria. The few edaphic differences between rivers (higher salinity at Bill Williams) had only weak connections with richness. A second study (20062007) focused on floristic richness at larger spatial scales. It revealed that during spring, and for the study cumulatively (spring and fall samplings combined), the riparian zone of the unregulated river had considerably more plant species. Annuals (vs. herbaceous perennials and woody species) showed the largest between-river difference. Relative richness of exotic (vs. native) species did not differ. We conclude that: (1) The legacy of reduced scouring frequency and extent at the Bill Williams has reduced the open space available for colonization by annuals; and (2) Change in forest biomass structure, more so than change in forest composition, is the major driver of changes in plant species richness along this flow-altered river. Our study informs dryland river management options by revealing trade-offs that exist between forest biomass structure and plant species richness.

This study uses aerial photography, sediment analysis, palynology indicators and hydraulic modelling to investigate the role of riparian vegetation in influencing the response of systems to disturbance, the trajectory of channel evolution and the potential for management. The study focuses on cleared and uncleared sites in the Yerritup catchment, along the south coast of Western Australia, that occur along a transect with a consistent stream gradient and landscape topographic setting.Downstream reaches show no gross botanical change, but gradual sediment deposition across the floodplain of up to 40 cmbased on palynological and sedimentary indicators. Channel response in the cleared section by incision, widening and floodplain degradation began rapidly after land clearing, but is driven by large flood events. Degradation of riparian vegetation has significantly increased the sensitivity of the system. The cleared reaches have transformed from a low-capacity channel, under-adjusted to the prevailing flow regime, to the large present channel that is now over-adjusted to the predominantly low to moderate seasonal (occasional flood) flow regime. Modelling of pre-settlement erosive potential reveals that the entire system was naturally sensitive to change, and was primed to erode once riparian vegetation was removed.The trajectory of channel evolution and the role of riparian vegetation is examined in relation to undisturbed reaches in the system and an appreciation of the historical range of variability in geomorphic response. Analysis of the patterns of contemporary vegetation growth identify the potential to re-establish vegetation where it is elevated from saline baseflow. However, the system is assessed as being close to a threshold where restoration is no longer possible and remediation options become more limited as eco-hydraulic and hydrochemical changes continue.

For decades, changes in invertebrate depth distribution have been investigated in relation to flood, low flow and drying events, but evidence for use of the hyporheic refuge remains equivocal. This review examines the evidence for the hyporheic zone's refugial role during adverse hydrological conditions. Refuge potential is influenced by determinants in four categories. First, refuge use varies spatially in relation to physical habitat parameters, including sediment porosity and hydrologic exchange. Second, refuge use is temporally variable and reflects disturbance characteristics including rate of onset. Third, refuge use is taxon-specific, depending on a range of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits. Fourth, the behaviours governing refuge use vary, with both active migrations and passive habitat use playing important roles in community persistence. These four determinants interact to influence refuge use; for example, the physical habitat providing an adequate refuge will vary between taxa. Despite this variability, the hyporheic zone is an important component in the suite of refuges that facilitate community resilience to disturbance events. As such, its ecological integrity should be safeguarded through sensitive management and effective rehabilitation schemes.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,63,4,,293,311,,10.1071/MF11196,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000302356200002

For this purpose, Q and R modes of cluster analyses and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to ten different-size watersheds in the western region of Saudi Arabia utilizing 18 morphometric descriptors (variables). The results show that the R-mode cluster analysis classifies the variables into three groups, whereas the Q-mode cluster analysis classifies watersheds according to the similarities in their major variables such as area, perimeter, total stream length and peak discharge. The first three components of PCA accounted for 86% of the total variance in the data and show more details concerning the parameter loadings and the degree of variable significance.",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,5,1,,147,157,,10.1007/s12517-010-0149-7,,,,,,1866-7511,,WOS:000299294800013

Fencing in the RCA excluded pasturing cattle to within similar to 3 to 5 m of the stream. Approximately 88% (26/32) of all comparisons of mean contaminant load reduction for lower, higher, and all stream flow conditions during the 5-yr study indicated net contaminant load reductions in the RCA; for the URCA, this percentage was 38% (12/32).

These respective percentages for the URCA were -9 and -57% (positive values are reductions; negative values are increases). However, potentially as a result of protected wildlife habitat in the RCA, the mean percent load reduction for Cryptosporidium for ""all flow"" was -321% for the RCA and 60% for the URCA; for Giardia, these respective percentages were -209% (RCA) and 73% (URCA).

Mediterranean climate regions are characterised by long summer droughts that usually involve flow intermittency in low- to mid-order streams. Flow intermittency implies flow cessation, drying and subsequent rewetting of the streambed, and affects both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. The balance between these processes, as well as the balance in the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) may change because of the ongoing increase in stream flow intermittency caused by global change in many regions. It is therefore crucial to understand better the consequences of this phenomenon. 2. Our two initial hypotheses were (i) that flow intermittency would impact more on autotrophic than on heterotrophic processes in stream biofilms owing to the higher water dependence of autotrophs, as well as differences in the water storage capacity of the stream biofilm compartments where autotrophic and heterotrophic processes mainly occur (surface cobbles versus hyporheic sediments) and (ii) that the C-N-P use by biofilms would change during the dry period (terrestrial phase) owing to the extreme water stress conditions. These hypotheses were tested by analysing the functional response of the main stream biofilms (epilithic, epipsammic and hyporheic) during flow cessation, desiccation and rewetting in a Mediterranean forested stream. The autotrophic response was characterised through changes in the photon yield, whereas the heterotrophic response was characterised by changes in the extracellular enzyme activities. 3. Streambed desiccation had clear effects on the functioning of stream biofilms. Autotrophic biomass decreased by 80% with streambed desiccation, but recovered rapidly after flow resumption. Heterotrophs were more resistant to water stress, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms where bacterial cell density decreased only by 20%. 4. Extracellular enzyme activities remained relatively high, and the balance in the C-N-P use by biofilms changed during the dry period. The C and P breakdown capacities were maintained during dry conditions, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms, but the degradation of N compounds sharply decreased. Elemental molar ratios (C:N and C:P) of the different biofilms also changed with streambed desiccation. C:P ratios increased from 80 to 300, while the C:N ratios increased from 10 to 16. 5. Given the contrasting responses of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the different biofilms, our results suggest that the current increase in flow intermittency extent is likely to increase the relative importance of heterotrophic processes in stream ecosystems, as well as the relative contribution of the hyporheic biofilm to C-N-P use. Our results further suggest that the longer streams remain dry, the more the biofilm stoichiometry will change.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,57,8,,1565,1578,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02818.x,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000306139300004

Statistical comparisons of isotopic niche space among functional groups suggested that macroinvertebrates obtained dietary C from both instream and riparian (terrestrial) sources and were more broadly dispersed in isotopic space than were fishes. Macroinvertebrates that fed on riparian sources were less likely to be consumed by fishes.

J.",Aestivation provides flexible mechanisms for survival of stream drying in a larval trichopteran (Leptoceridae),"Some freshwater species aestivate to resist drying; however, little is known about factors affecting post-aestivation survival. Climate change prolongs drying and may make short bursts of flow more frequent in southern Australian streams, thereby affecting aestivation success. The tolerance of larval Lectrides varians (Mosley) to drying was tested by inducing aestivation in dry or moist sediment and then re-immersing larvae and measuring survival and activity. Survival did not differ between individuals that were continually immersed (78%) or aestivating on moist sediment (70.5%) after 16 weeks. Survival was significantly lower on dry sediment (29.3%). Furthermore, some larvae showed delayed responses to re-immersion; 65% of individuals showed activity within 4.5 h, whereas over 30% of larvae did not become active until 72 h after re-immersion. L. varians can survive extended periods (112 days) without surface water, showing a bimodal response to re-immersion that increases the likelihood of population persistence by enabling some larvae to remain aestivating during short-lived bursts of stream flow. L. varians populations will therefore be more robust to prolonged stream drying and short-lived flow events than are some other insect taxa, although as the duration of aestivation increases larval survivorship decreases, suggesting that there are limits to the flexibility of aestivation traits.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,63,9,,821,826,,10.1071/MF12095,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000309536000007

The groundwater recharge in Jafr basin takes place primarily in the outcrop area of the western highlands by direct and indirect infiltration of rainfall. Due to sparseness of vegetation and steep topography, most of the recharge occurs by infiltration of runoff accumulating in the wadi beds during rainstorms. The long-term temporal and spatial average annual rainfall of 53.5 mm was distributed as 2.61 mm (4.9%) of surface runoff 50.6 mm (94.6%) of evapotranspiration, and 0.27 mm (0.5%) of recharge.

To assess the spatial and temporal variation of fish assemblages and their response to the hydrological changes caused by two different types of flow regulation, we selected three sampling sites in four rivers with different levels of regulation, two in a permanent river system and another two on a temporary one, which we sampled in four different annual seasons. In the permanent system, hydroelectrical regulation decreased hydrological variability, which affected fluvial specialist species, benefitting the generalist ones, and created a more homogeneous community that presented less intra-annual variation. In the temporary system, agricultural regulation caused an inversion of the hydrological cycle, maintaining a moderate flow volume throughout the drought period that benefited the introduced, generalist and more tolerant species. Monthly volume was recognized, in a temporal scale, as the most important hydrological feature for assemblages' structure, predicting the intra-annual variation of several ecological guilds. This study provides important considerations for dam management and riverine ecosystems conservation.

Invertebrate,2013,"Almeida, David; Merino-Aguirre, Raquel; Angeler, David G.",Benthic invertebrate communities in regulated Mediterranean streams and least-impacted tributaries,"Flow regulation is generally perceived to negatively influence fluvial ecosystems through alterations of natural habitat conditions, particularly in highly variable Mediterranean streams. However, the detection of impact may depend on chosen metrics, requiring a multiple-lines-of-evidence approach for ecologically relevant impact assessment. In this study, we compare the community structure, the trophic function, the microhabitat influence and the body condition of benthic invertebrates between the regulated Bullaque River and unregulated tributaries (Guadiana River basin, central Spain). Invertebrates and physical microhabitats were studied seasonally in 2010. Total abundance, EPT abundance, Rheoindex and LIFE metrics were higher in the regulated river during summer, whereas Shannon diversity was lower. Rheoindex and LIFE were higher in the tributaries during winter. Filterers were very abundant in spring and summer in the tributaries and the regulated stream, respectively. Deposit feeders dominated during summer in the tributaries. Despite these differences, ANOSIM revealed similar community structure and feeding groups characteristics in both fluvial system types. In addition, body condition, measured as fluctuating asymmetry level, indicated that darning created favourable developmental conditions for several invertebrate species in the Bullaque River. This suggests that darning surprisingly buffered from the adverse environmental conditions inflicted by seasonal summer drougths, which occur recurrently in Mediterranean areas. Results also suggest that the application of fluctuating asymmetry could therefore be promising for revealing integral ecological responses to different and often combined forms of anthropogenic and natural disturbance.

Our hypothesis was that endemic and alien species, considered important in defining conservation priorities along rivers, have different patterns of distribution and their coexistence indicates human impacts on fluvial systems, which can cause natural habitat loss. Generalized Additive Models were used to model the distribution patterns of endemic and alien species along the longitudinal gradient. They showed that endemic species were linked to the most natural areas in the middle and upper sections of the rivers, whereas the distribution of aliens in middle and lower sections can be regarded as a consequence of human impact. This finding underlined the presence in the middle sections of the rivers of areas with important floristic features that are also affected by alien species. What currently seems a situation of equilibrium turns out to call for careful control, first and foremost, by maintaining riparian vegetation.

Specifically, cross sections were measured in 1994, 2001, and 2008 to evaluate changes in channel form. Aerial photographs between 1935 and 2007 were also compared to assess changes in channel sinuosity.

These measurements indicate that the channel is stabilizing. Sinuosity changed only slightly. Overall, climate patterns that cause large flood events appear to have been the major influence on the channel form. Still, exclusion of livestock and all-terrain vehicles, which increased vegetation in the riparian areas, also appeared to mitigate flood impacts. The stream channel appears to have been more resilient to the impacts of the flood in 2005, when vegetation was better established, than to the flood of 1993, when past management influences were still lingering.",PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY,34,1,,60,73,,10.1080/02723646.2013.778689,,,,,,0272-3646,,WOS:000319565000005

We increased the concentrations of N and P in the stream water 1.6-4-fold following a before-after control-impact paired series (BACIPS) design in each stream, and evaluated changes in the biomass of bacteria, primary producers, invertebrates and fish in the enriched (E) versus control (C) reaches after nutrient addition through a predictive-BACIPS approach. The treatment produced variable biomass responses (2-77% of explained variance) among biological communities and streams. The greatest biomass response was observed for algae in the Andean stream (77% of the variance), although fish also showed important biomass responses (about 9-48%). The strongest biomass response to enrichment (77% in all biological compartments) was found in the Andean stream. The magnitude and seasonality of biomass responses to enrichment were highly site specific, often depending on the basal nutrient concentration and on windows of ecological opportunity (periods when environmental constraints other than nutrients do not limit biomass growth). The Pampean stream, with high basal nutrient concentrations, showed a weak response to enrichment (except for invertebrates), whereas the greater responses of Andean stream communities were presumably favored by wider windows of ecological opportunity in comparison to those from the Mediterranean stream. Despite variation among sites, enrichment globally stimulated the algal-based food webs (algae and invertebrate grazers) but not the detritus-based food webs (bacteria and invertebrate shredders). This study shows that nutrient enrichment tends to globally enhance the biomass of stream biological assemblages, but that its magnitude and extent within the food web are complex and are strongly determined by environmental factors and ecosystem structure.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,8,1,,,,14002,10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014002,,,,,,1748-9326,,WOS:000316998300010

Nothobranchius furzeri is an annual fish from south-eastern Africa, inhabiting discrete temporary savannah pools outside main river alluvia. Their dispersal is limited and population processes affecting its genetic structure are likely a combination of those affecting terrestrial and aquatic taxa. N. furzeri is a model taxon in ageing research and several populations of known geographical origin are used in laboratory studies. Here, we analysed the genetic structure, diversity, historical demography and temporal patterns of divergence in natural populations of N. furzeri across its entire distribution range.Results: Genetic structure and historical demography of N. furzeri were analysed using a combination of mitochondrial (partial cytochrome b sequences, 687 bp) and nuclear (13 microsatellites) markers in 693 fish from 36 populations. Genetic markers consistently demonstrated strong population structuring and suggested two main genetic groups associated with river basins. The split was dated to the Pliocene (>2 Mya). The northern group inhabits savannah pools across the basin of the intermittent river Chefu in south-western Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe. The southern group (from southernmost Mozambique) is subdivided, with the River Limpopo forming a barrier (maximum divergence time 1 Mya). A strong habitat fragmentation (isolated temporary pools) is reflected in significant genetic structuring even between adjacent pools, with a major influence of genetic drift and significant isolation-by-distance. Analysis of historical demography revealed that the expansion of both groups is ongoing, supported by frequent founder effects in marginal parts of the range and evidence of secondary contact between Chefu and Limpopo populations.Conclusions: We demonstrated: (1) ancient (pre-Pleistocene) divergence between the two main N. furzeri lineages, their recent secondary contact and lack of reproductive isolation; (2) important genetic structuring attributed to the fragmented nature of their environment and isolation-by-distance, suggesting that dispersal is limited, occurs over short distances and is not directly associated with river routes; (3) an apparent role of the River Limpopo as a barrier to dispersal and gene flow.",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,13,,,,,196,10.1186/1471-2148-13-196,,,,,,1471-2148,,WOS:000324749400003

The need to understand hydrology-ecology linkages in natural systems has increased owing to the prospect of climate change and flow regime management, especially in water-scarce areas such as Mediterranean basins. Our research quantified the macroinvertebrate community response at family, genus and species level to natural flow regime dynamics in freshwater streams of a Mediterranean semiarid basin (Segura River, SE Spain) and identified the flow components that influence the composition and richness of biotic assemblages. Flow stability and minimum flows were the principal hydrological drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas the magnitude of average and maximum flows had a limited effect. Perennial stable streams were characterized by flow sensitive lotic taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) and intermittent streams by predominately lentic taxa (Odonata, Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Diptera). Relatively minor biological changes were recorded for intermediate flow regime classes along a gradient of flow stability. Seasonal variation and minimum flows are key hydrological components that need to be considered for river management and environmental flows in the Segura River basin and other Mediterranean basins. The anthropogenic modification of these parameters, due to both human activities and climate change, would probably lead to significant changes in the structure and composition of communities in perennial stable streams. This would be characterized by a reduction of flow sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa and an increase in more resilient Odonata, Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Diptera taxa.

Hydrological connectivity through the catchment and along the stream network influences not only the timing and the magnitude of terrestrial inputs to stream ecosystems, but also regulates stream metabolism and biogeochemical cycling. In mediterranean climate regions (med-regions), there is a marked seasonal alternation of dry and wet periods, and streams experience a wide range of hydrological conditions from floods to droughts. Moreover, nutrient dynamics in med-streams are highly variable within the year and between years compared to temperate streams. In this review, we explore how seasonal changes in hydrological connectivity and hydrological extremes affect nutrient cycling and transport at different spatial scales in med-catchments. We show that during the dry period, the stream network contracts more severely in med-catchments than in temperate catchments. During the contraction phase, upland-stream disconnection decreases nutrient supply from terrestrial ecosystems, while stream fragmentation increases the spatial variation of stream nutrient concentrations. Moreover, the precipitation regime typical of med-regions (with irregular distribution of precipitation and episodic large rainfall events) decreases the ability of terrestrial and aquatic biota to retain nutrients and favours nutrient export to downstream ecosystems. Altogether, this hydrological setting confers to med-streams a characteristic temporal pattern in stream nutrient dynamics that is analogous to a particular biogeochemical heartbeat with higher amplitude, variation and unpredictability than that observed in temperate streams.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,31,42,,10.1007/s10750-012-1246-2,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400002

In late winter 2010, we sampled invertebrate assemblages in 12 reaches of a large arid-land stream network (including perennial and intermittent headwaters, intermittent middle reaches and perennial rivers) in south-east Arizona, U.S.A. Intermittent reaches had then been flowing for c.60days, following a dry period of more than 450days. We sampled a subset of the perennial study reaches three more times between 2009 and 2011. Since intermittent reaches were dry during these additional sampling periods, we used assemblage data from two other intermittent streams in the study network (sampled in 200405 and 2010) to explore interannual variability in intermittent stream assemblage composition. 3. Invertebrate richness was lowest in intermittent reaches, despite their often being connected to species-rich perennial reaches. The assemblages of these intermittent reaches were not simply a subset of the species in perennial streams, but rather were dominated by a suite of stoneflies, blackflies and midges with adaptations to intermittency (e.g. egg and/or larval diapause). On average, 86% of individuals in these samples were specialists or exclusive to intermittent streams. Predators were 714 times more abundant in perennial than in intermittent reaches. 4. Despite being separated by long distances (1225km) and having very different physical characteristics, the assemblages of perennial headwaters and rivers were more similar to one another than to intervening intermittent reaches, emphasising the prime importance of local hydrology in this system. 5. The duration and recurrence intervals of dry periods, and the relative importance of dispersal from perennial refuges, probably influence the magnitude of biological differences between neighbouring perennial and temporary streams. Although perennial headwaters supported the highest diversity of invertebrates, intermittent reaches supported a number of unique or locally rare species and as such contribute to regional species diversity and should be included in conservation planning.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,5,,1016,1028,,10.1111/fwb.12105,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000317625900014

H.",Invertebrate communities of groundwater-dependent refugia with varying hydrology and riparian cover during a supraseasonal drought,"Extreme disturbances eliminate aquatic biota and alter community structure and function. During a supraseasonal drought in north-central Texas in the summer and fall 2006, macroinvertebrate communities from persistent groundwater-dependent macrohabitats of varying hydrology and riparian shading were investigated to study their role as invertebrate refugia, and to characterize the taxonomic and functional community structure of benthic assemblages. Ash Creek was the only stream with surface flow within a 35-km radius during the drought. Two perennial and three intermittent stream sites were studied that included perennial riffles, a perennial pool, shaded disconnected pools, and disconnected pools in full sun. Riffles had significantly higher taxa richness, EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness, proportion of lotic taxa, and diversity than other macrohabitats. Macrohabitats were refugia for 106 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, and perennially flowing habitats contained 19 taxa (17.9% of total taxa) not collected in disconnected pools. Larvae and pupae of caddisflies Marilia spp., Oecetis spp., Helicopsyche spp., and riffle beetle Microcylloepus spp. larvae and adults demonstrated resistance to drought by their presence in shaded disconnected pools without surface flow for over a month. Gathering-collectors were the most dominant and taxonomically diverse functional feeding group (FFG) in all macrohabitats. Scrapers ranked second in dominance in riffles, followed by predators; however, predators were the second most dominant FFG in all pool habitats. Continued overabstraction of groundwater in the region could lead to loss of perennial riffles and pools and extirpation of lotic taxa, such as Lutrochus spp., Mayatrichia spp., and Marilia spp., and dramatically alter community structure and function.",JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,28,2,,251,270,,10.1080/02705060.2012.753121,,,,,,0270-5060,,WOS:000318775300008
Assessment,2013,"Callow, J. N.; Boggs, G. S.",Studying reach-scale spatial hydrology in ungauged catchments,"Dryland regions are home to some of the most poorly gauged rivers on Earth. Consequently, these regions lack a detailed understanding of the hydrology, are associated with underdevelopment and significant socio-economic disadvantage, though there is increasing pressure to develop the water resources in these areas. However, this is often limited by a lack of data from which to understand regional hydrology and water-dependent processes and make informed water resource management decisions. This paper presents a novel approach to directly map, from remotely sensed imagery, the five flow types and six hydrological metrics defined as the most significant determinants of ecological condition of dryland rivers (Flow (duration of flow), Amplitude (last maximum depth), Pulse Shape (duration of rising limb and falling limb), Duration (present length of inundation), Connection (duration of present downstream connection)).At fourteen ""virtual"" gauging stations in two rivers (Newcastle Creek and Playford River) on the Barkly Tablelands, northern Australia, daily classified Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery was used to map flow types and metrics at 250 m resolution, across 1996 km(2). The performance of the ""virtual"" gauging stations is validated against traditionally gauged data at two locations and confirms that hydrological data significant for ecology can be extracted from daily flood mapping using remotely sensed MODIS imagery. Results found a pronounced downstream trend in flow characteristics from more ephemeral uplands to seasonally-inundated lowlands. Significant between reach variability in the Duration and Connection is also noted, which is related to cross section morphology and river position. It is suggested that this approach could be applied to other poorly or ungauged large, dryland rivers, where the requirements, including limited cloud cover, long (weeks to months) flood pulses, inundation widths of greater than 2 km, and lateral floodplain gradients of less than approximately 0.005 m/m are met. This novel approach for the measurement of ungauged basins offers significant potential to allow research relevant to hydrology and water-dependent processes where traditional approaches to dryland river hydrology are limited by the lack of gauging infrastructure, or by complex multi-channel and low-gradient geomorphology.

We assessed the ecological effects of Eucalyptus globulus leachate with and without aeration (i.e., low flow vs pool scenarios) on microbial decomposition of eucalyptus leaves and on toxicity to and survival, avoidance, and feeding behavior of Chironomus riparius Meigen (Diptera:Chironomidae), Echinogammarus meridionalis Pinkster (Amphipoda:Gammaridae), and Sericostoma vittatum Rambur (Trichoptera:Sericostomatidae). Eucalyptus globulus leaves immersed in a gradient of aerated or nonaerated eucalyptus leachate (100, 40.0, 16.0, 6.40, 2.50% volume/volume) were colonized by species-poor fungal assemblages. Leaf mass loss did not differ among treatments, but hypoxia suppressed conidia production and negatively affected fungal biomass. A concentration-dependent effect on fungal biomass was observed in aerated leaf extracts. A trade-off was found between the stimulatory effect of leachate nutrients and inhibitory effects of secondary compounds at leachate concentrations of 16 to 40%, and microbial respiration was depressed at concentrations >16% in nonaerated conditions. Only S. vittatum discriminated leaves conditioned in aerated water from leaves conditioned in nonaerated leachates. Leachates negatively affected all species, mostly in nonaerated conditions. Maximum leachate concentration caused mortality of 100% of E. meridionalis and 26 to 40% of C. riparius, regardless of aeration, and 70% of S. vittatum in nonaerated conditions. Sericostoma vittatum avoided the highest leachate concentrations, but C. riparius and E. meridionalis did not.

This study evaluates agricultural nonpoint source nutrient pollution transport in a wetland-stream-lake complex in a mountain, tussock grassland catchment in the South Island, New Zealand. Flow and water-quality monitoring in the Lake Clearwater catchment during three flow events from May to August 2010 (autumn high flow, winter low flow, and winter high flow) showed high concentrations and exceedances of water quality guidelines for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in small ephemeral streams draining agricultural land during high flows. Concentrations were attenuated through the wetlands to below guidelines, with the exception of TN which still remained slightly higher. Most TN was in the organic form above and below the wetland, suggesting N sources from animal waste/agricultural land and organic material and vegetation within the wetland. Most TP was particulate associated with suspended solids during high flows. Dissolved forms of N and P generally were below guidelines. Flows and loads (instantaneous and daily) increased at the lake outlet during winter high flow, indicating unaccounted sources to the lake from groundwater, the wetlands, or the lake sediments, and seasonal N saturation. Infiltration losses to shallow groundwater along the main perennial tributary likely re-appear as discharge to the wetlands and lake downstream. Surface-groundwater interactions play a dominant role in N transport to the wetland complex due to highly permeable soils and glacial alluvial deposits. Loads and unit loads of TN and TP were also elevated in the ephemeral streams. Results show that TN and TP concentrations and unit loads during high flows in ephemeral streams in this mountain grassland catchment are similar to, or higher than, values for impacted lowland pasture catchments. Although impacts to the wetland ecosystem have not been observed to date, the lake is shifting toward a mesotrophic state, and further research is needed to elucidate impacts of nutrient loads and help meet conservation and restoration goals.",WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,224,10,,,,1695,10.1007/s11270-013-1695-x,,,,,,0049-6979; 1573-2932,,WOS:000326051700006

The origin, properties and role of DOM are increasingly characterised in lakes, rivers and streams, but little is known about DOM characteristics in ephemeral washes, which are the most common water flows in Mediterranean landscapes. Here, we examine the patterns in the optical properties of DOM in ephemeral washes draining a small catchment in the island of Menorca, Western Mediterranean. We used concentration data (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen) and several spectroscopic descriptors (SUVA(254), absorption coefficient at 440 nm, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices) to assess changes in DOM concentrations and quality at both seasonal and spatial scales. Two periods were clearly distinguished in the DOM properties: autumn and winter-spring. In autumn, which includes the first flows of the hydrological year, DOM showed an aromatic character and was spatially homogenous over the catchment. In winter-spring, DOM was smaller and recently produced, and a considerable spatial heterogeneity was observed in all descriptors. The variability in DOM concentrations and quality was driven by hydromorphology and by the landscape features of the catchment, but the influence of these drivers on DOM properties changed along the hydrological year. In autumn, hydromorphology was the main factor determining DOM properties, whereas in winter-spring the land uses in the watershed highly determined the observed differences in DOM quality between subcatchments.",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,112,41699,,261,274,,10.1007/s10533-012-9723-2,,4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions,"SEP 19-23, 2010","Bioemco Lab (Biogeochemistry and Ecol Continental Ecosystems), Soil Organ Matter Grp",FRANCE,0168-2563,,WOS:000316018800019

It is the main tributary of an important shellfish farming site: the Thau lagoon. The present study aims at establishing the presence of OTs on a 1.5 km long reach of the river into which a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) discharges. The study is carried out during steady-state flow conditions over two consecutive years and investigates potential OTs sources in everyday domestic activities. Routine field monitoring was carried out over a 5 month period during the springs of 2008 and 2009.The results establish the presence of butyltins and octyltins throughout the 1.5 km long reach at concentrations exceeding the maximum allowable concentration levels imposed by the water framework directive. The WWTP is recognized as an important OTs point source; however, using trace and rare earth elements as tracers, an urban stormwater sewage gutter is identified as a secondary source. Its impact on the river's pollutant loads is however variable in time because of flow intermittency.

This study addressed the influence of headwater areas (ephemeral and intermittent) on stormflow characteristics following harvest within three first order catchments in the Upper Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi. Four treatments including two Best Management Practices (BMPs) were applied: BMP1 - removal of all merchantable stems while leaving understory intact with minimum surface soil disturbance; BMP2 same as BMP1 with the addition of logging debris to the drainage channel; Clearcut-total harvest with no BMPs applied; Reference left uncut as a control. Following harvesting, the increase in water table depth ranged from 1.6 cm in BMP1 to 28.2 cm in the clearcut treatment during 2008, and from 10.5 cm in BMP1 to 54.2 cm in BMP2 during 2009. However, impacts of timber harvesting on peak discharge, storm discharge, and time of concentration were not consistent with water table response.

Seasonal human demand for water in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions) is high, leading to intense competition for water with riverine communities often containing many endemic species. The responses of river communities to human alterations of land use, vegetation, hydrological, and hydrochemical conditions are similar in mediterranean and other climatic regions. High variation in hydrological regimes in med-regions, however, tends to exacerbate the magnitude of these responses. For example, land use changes promote longer dry season flows, concentrating contaminants, allowing the accumulation of detritus, algae, and plants, and fostering higher temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen levels, all of which may extirpate sensitive native species. Exotic species often thrive in med-rivers altered by human activity, further homogenizing river communities worldwide. We recommend that future research rigorously evaluate the effects of management and restoration practices on river ecosystems, delineate the cause-effect pathways leading from human perturbations to stream biological communities, and incorporate analyses of the effects of scale, land use heterogeneity, and high temporal hydrological variability on stream communities.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,383,425,,10.1007/s10750-012-1333-4,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000325182400017

Sampling efficiency and completeness and detection biases associated with pitfall-trap and quadrat samples were compared at six sites in the dry beds of two New Zealand rivers. On average, pitfall-trap samples contained 3.5 times more taxa than quadrat samples, and pitfall traps required less time to collect as many taxa as quadrats. Among all taxa collected, 80% were exclusive to pitfall traps and 4% to quadrat samples. Among-sites differences in invertebrate composition were greater in pitfall-trap samples than in quadrat samples. Rarefaction curves indicated that eight to eleven pitfall traps/100 m(2) were necessary to collect most of the common taxa in the study sites. Differences in the performance of pitfall traps and quadrats in dry riverbeds may be due to the absence of vegetation, to the large range of taxa considered, and to diel movements of some taxa.

Intermittent stream food webs have received less attention but may be even more dependent on terrestrial invertebrate subsidies because of limited aquatic invertebrate resources. The objectives of this research were: (i) to quantify the abundance and biomass of aquatic, adult aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates in and entering two Appalachian intermittent streams to determine how these resources vary with environmental factors such as stream flow and (ii) to determine the effects of experimental reductions in terrestrial invertebrate subsidies on brook trout diet. Stream flow was the main factor driving total invertebrate abundance and biomass, and these resources decreased by 71% as the summer dry season progressed. Terrestrial invertebrates represented only 7% of total resource abundance, but made up 54% of brook trout diet by abundance. Experimental reductions in terrestrial invertebrate subsidies resulted in a 49% decrease in terrestrial invertebrate abundance, which resulted in a 55% decrease in terrestrial invertebrates in brook trout diet samples. In contrast to studies of other salmonids in perennial streams, brook trout in these intermittent streams did not switch to consuming more aquatic invertebrates when terrestrial invertebrates were experimentally reduced. Therefore, land use or vegetation changes that cause reductions in terrestrial invertebrate resources may adversely affect brook trout populations in intermittent streams by reducing caloric intake as fish prepare for autumn spawning.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,11,,2423,2438,,10.1111/fwb.12221,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000325156400019

They range from highly stable, perennial ground- or snow-fed systems to highly ephemeral, unpredictable ones in semi-arid environments. Spatial and temporal complexity inherent in these systems presents challenges for ecological status assessment and defining reference conditions, particularly as many areas have been extensively transformed through anthropogenic activities. Temporal variability driven by sequential and predictable, seasonal events of flooding and drying accentuates the need to take season and/or hydrological period into account. Intermittent streams, which are common in mediterranean regions (med-regions) and which have aquatic communities distinct from perennial streams, are often not incorporated in bioassessment and present distinct challenges. Med-regions are also known for their high biodiversity and rates of endemism, as well as large numbers of introduced species. Med-regions are expected to be among the most affected by global climate change and, in these systems, climate change is an additional driver influencing ecosystems that are already stressed.

Data from 12 spatial surveys of the VSne river were examined. Physico-chemical parameters, major ion, and nutrient concentrations were measured. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analyses were performed. ANOVA revealed significant spatial differences for conductivity and major ion but no significant spatial differences for nutrient concentrations even if higher average concentrations were observed at stations located downstream from sewage effluent discharge points. Significant temporal differences were observed among all the parameters. Karstic springs had a marked dilution effect on the direct disposal of sewage effluents. During high-flow periods, nutrient concentrations were high to moderate whereas nutrient concentrations ranged from moderate to bad at stations located downstream from the direct inputs of sewage effluents during low-flow periods. Principal component analysis showed that water quality parameters that explained the water quality of the VSne river were highly dependent on hydrological conditions. Cluster analysis showed that when the karstic springs were flowing, water quality was homogeneous all along the river, whereas when karstic springs were dry, water quality at the monitoring stations was more fragmented. These results underline the importance of considering hydrological conditions when monitoring the water quality of temporary rivers.

Samples were collected in June 2006, May 2007, September 2010, and July 2011.

In contrast, elmid beetles were often, but not always, absent from intermittent streams even when water was present, and species dominance was usually different among the years when elmid beetles were present in those streams.

To evaluate the effect of drought on functioning of wetlands and their interstitial zones, we studied the interstitial communities at seven stations located in five former channels of the Rhne River. Change in interstitial assemblages was assessed over a 32-year period in one wetland and over the entire floodplain between 1987 and 2010, at depths of 50 and 100 cm within the sediment. Over the 32-year period, we highlighted some links between environmental changes and variations in interstitial assemblages: a decrease in abundance and diversity of the hypogean fauna and a reverse pattern for Ephemeroptera and Cladocera. At the floodplain scale, several changes in habitat characteristics were observed and two drying modalities were identified: the formation of isolated pools and the complete disappearance of surface water. In isolated pools, the low turnover of surface water promoted a decrease in water quality, an increase in the abundance of benthic invertebrates in the interstitial habitat and a decrease in the abundance of hypogean invertebrates. In completely dried-out sites, the abundance and diversity of benthic taxa decreased, while the hypogean fauna remained dominant.

During both experiments, we monitored the presence or absence of predators by visual observation and from scat surveys. We demonstrated a negative effect of terrestrial predators on Central Stonerller survival in the artificial pools, and larger individuals were more susceptible to predation. In contrast, small crayfish experienced low survival at all depths and large crayfish were preyed upon much less intensively during the tethering study, particularly in the pool with larger substrate.

Seasonal flow intermittence in streams often coincides with early leaf abscission of riparian vegetation due to water stress. When accumulated on dry stream beds or in remaining pools, leaves are exposed to solar radiation or fermentation processes, respectively. However, very little information exists on how these preconditioning processes could affect leaf decomposition when stream flow has recovered.2. We simulated natural preconditioning of leaves by irradiation with UV-VIS fluorescent lamps and incubation under anoxic conditions. Mass loss rates of preconditioned leaf litter from deciduous trees (Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus excelsior, Populus tremula and Quercus petreae) were quantified in a temporary stream during base flow conditions. Coarse and fine mesh litter bags were used to study the effect of benthic macroinvertebrates and microorganisms on leaf mass loss.3. Preconditioning reduced the concentration of macronutrients such as P, K and Mg and increased the relative cellulose content of the leaves. Preconditioning changed the fungal community structure (analysed by DGGE) depending on leaf species and sampling date. Preconditioning in anoxic conditions also suppressed fungal decomposer biomass (measured as ergosterol) by 42% resulting in 33% lower mass loss rates in fine mesh bags. In contrast, mass loss rates were not affected by preconditioning when macroinvertebrate decomposers had access to the leaf litter.4. In streams exhibiting seasonal flow intermittence, preconditioning will influence organic carbon dynamics towards lower rates of microbially mediated turnover and towards poorer quality of downstream-transported material.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,9,,1918,1931,,10.1111/fwb.12180,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000321328800013
Assessment,2013,"Dobbie, Melissa J.; Negus, Peter",Addressing statistical and operational challenges in designing large-scale stream condition surveys,"Implementing a statistically valid and practical monitoring design for large-scale stream condition monitoring and assessment programs can be difficult due to factors including the likely existence of a diversity of ecosystem types such as ephemeral streams over the sampling domain; limited resources to undertake detailed monitoring surveys and address knowledge gaps; and operational constraints on effective sampling at monitoring sites. In statistical speak, these issues translate to defining appropriate target populations and sampling units; designing appropriate spatial and temporal sample site selection methods; selection and use of appropriate indicators; and setting effect sizes with limited ecological and statistical information about the indicators of interest. We identify the statistical and operational challenges in designing large-scale stream condition surveys and discuss general approaches for addressing them.

At the regional scale, we investigated a 29-km-long, expanding and contracting, losing (average flow decrease 2.5 m(3) s(-1) km(-1)) and a 12.5-km-long, stable, gaining (average increase 0.3 m(3) s(-1) km(-1)) reach. At the local scale, we sampled riffle head and riffle tail units nested within the losing and gaining reaches. At the regional scale, we characterized vertical exchange by strong downwelling (negative vertical hydraulic gradient; VHG) in the losing and moderate upwelling (positive VHG) in the gaining reach. Nutrients, such as NO3-N and dissolved N (DN), and periphyton biomass (AFDM) showed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower concentration in the losing than in the gaining reach. A contrasting pattern emerged for sediment respiration. Expansion and contraction dynamics (i.e., drying and rewetting) in the losing reach negatively affected chlorophyll a and AFDM. At the local scale, VHG was negative at riffle heads and positive at riffle tails nested in the gaining reach, but variables did not respond to vertical exchange at riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing or gaining reach. However, averaged data from riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing reach compared to averaged data for riffle heads and riffle tails in the gaining reach showed the same pattern as found in the regional investigation.

Salt Creek is fed by an underground spring and is comprised of numerous pools, runs, and marshes that exhibit substantial variability in temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen concentrations. In addition, the wetted area of Salt Creek is reduced throughout the summer months due to high rates of evaporation, with some reaches drying completely. Therefore, it seems logical that short- and long-term movement patterns may play an important role in Salt Creek pupfish population dynamics. The objective of this study was to describe coarse-scale movements of Salt Creek pupfish in Salt Creek during their breeding season from March to May. Sex ratios and length-frequency distributions varied spatially within Salt Creek, suggesting population segregation during the breeding season. Long-distance movements were generally rare, although two fish moved more than 1.2km. Movement in upstream reaches was rare or absent, in contrast to the greater movement observed in downstream reaches (29% of recaptures). Temporal trends and demographic patterns in movement were not observed. Because the two most downstream habitats dry up in the summer, our results indicate that coarse-scale movements that re-populate downstream reaches likely occur during other times of year. Consequently, the importance of small- and large-scale movements is influenced by season. Further assessment of Salt Creek movement patterns conducted during other times of year may better illuminate long-distance movement patterns and source-sink dynamics.",JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,28,1,,27,38,,10.1080/02705060.2012.718250,,,,,,0270-5060,,WOS:000322302900003

Conversely, excessive algal production can have negative effects on higher trophic levels. The present study examined permanent waterholes in a disconnected wet-dry tropical river to determine the controls on algal production. Primary production in this river system was high compared with arid-zone and perennially flowing tropical rivers. Phytoplankton biomass increased over the dry season but this appeared to be because waterhole volume decreased, due to evaporation. Nitrogen (N) was the key limiting nutrient for phytoplankton, with rapid N turnover times, depletion of particulate N-15-nitrogen reflecting increasing N fixationover the dry season, and N stimulation in phytoplankton bioassays. The waterholes were shallow, providing sufficient light for accumulation of benthic algal biomass. Exclosure experiments were also conducted to determine the impact of top-down control on benthic algal biomass, with no evidence that exclusion of fish and crustaceans increased benthic algal biomass. The shallow off-channel waterhole in our study had substantially higher concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a than did the on-channel waterholes. This suggests that future anthropogenic changes, such as increased water extraction and increased nutrient inputs, could make the waterholes more vulnerable to deteriorating water quality, such as e. g. algal blooms, low concentrations of dissolved oxygen.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,64,7,,585,598,,10.1071/MF12299,,,,,,1323-1650,,WOS:000321264800001

The objectives of this study were to determine how bacterial community composition responded to hydrological fragmentation in summer, and to evaluate whether the seasonal shifts in community composition predominate over the effects of episodic habitat fragmentation. The bacterial community was assessed along the intermittent stream Fuirosos (Spain), at different levels of phylogenetic resolution by in situ hybridization, fingerprinting, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The hydrological fragmentation of the stream network strongly altered the biogeochemical conditions with the depletion of oxidized solutes and caused changes in dissolved organic carbon characteristics. In the isolated ponds, beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria increased their abundance with a gradual reduction of the alpha-diversity as pond isolation time increased. Moreover, fingerprinting analysis clearly showed a shift in community composition between summer and autumn.

Our objective was to elucidate how litter age and solar radiation affect the bacterial utilization of DOM released from floodplain leaf litter when inundated. Leachate percent BDOC ranged from 22 to 47% for three different leaf species and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing litter age. However, total BDOC (mg C L-1) was unrelated to litter age. Bacterial utilization of DOM leachate collected from litter aged on the floodplain for four and six months significantly increased following 48 h of irradiation for all species but there was no difference for leachate from fresh and two month old litter. The photo-mediated increase in percent BDOC was concomitant with a decrease in aromatic carbon content, as SUVA(254) values decreased on average 9 +/- 6% for light exposure experiments.

Annual catches and effort in the lower Murray River system were stable for 25 years, but proportional contribution to the total catch from each of freshwater, estuarine and adjacent marine habitats, and the species within them varied. Fish assemblages generally differed between subsequent 5-year periods, with the exception of 1989-1993 when floods occurred in 4 out of 5 years, and the following 5-year period (1994-1998). Species richness declined steeply over 25 years in freshwater and estuarine habitat and species diversity (Hill's H (2)) also declined after 2001 in estuarine habitat. Species with rapid growth and early maturation (opportunistic strategists), increasingly dominated catches, whilst species with slow growth and late maturation (periodic strategists) declined. Truncated population age structures suggested longevity overfishing of three periodic strategist species: golden perch (M. ambigua), black bream (A. butcheri), mulloway (A. japonicus) and a fourth species with an intermediate strategy, greenback flounder (R. tapirina). This has implications for management because loss of older/larger individuals suggests reduced capacity to withstand or recover from deteriorated environmental conditions associated with a historically extreme drought in the lower Murray River system. Management of these species should seek to preserve the remnant population age structures and then to rebuild age structures by allowing recruits to become established in the adult population.

It is expected that the future effects of climate change could be particularly severe in mediterranean climate (med-) regions, which host many endemic species already under great stress from the high level of human development. In this article, we review the climate and climate-induced changes in streams of med-regions and the responses of stream biota, focusing on both observed and anticipated ecological responses. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and conservation challenges. Expected climate alterations have already been observed in the last decades, and include: increased annual average air temperatures; decreased annual average precipitation; hydrologic alterations; and an increase in frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, such as floods, droughts and fires. Recent observations, which are concordant with forecasts built, show stream biota of med-regions when facing climate changes tend to be displaced towards higher elevations and upper latitudes, communities tend to change their composition and homogenize, while some life-history traits seem to provide biota with resilience and resistance to adapt to the new conditions (as being short-lived, small, and resistant to low streamflow and desiccation). Nevertheless, such responses may be insufficient to cope with current and future environmental changes. Accurate forecasts of biotic changes and possible adaptations are difficult to obtain in med-regions mainly because of the difficulty of distinguishing disturbances due to natural variability from the effects of climate change, particularly regarding hydrology. Long-term studies are needed to disentangle such variability and improve knowledge regarding the ecological responses and the detection of early warning signals to climate change. Investments should focus on taxa beyond fish and macroinvertebrates, and in covering the less studied regions of Chile and South Africa. Scientists, policy makers and water managers must be involved in the climate change dialogue because the freshwater conservation concerns are huge.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,331,351,,10.1007/s10750-012-1244-4,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000325182400015

However, run-on areas and drainage lines in arid regions receive more water more often than adjacent habitats, and frequently sustain relatively high levels of primary productivity. These landscape features therefore may support higher biotic diversity than other habitats, and potentially act as refuges for desert vertebrates and other biota during droughts. We used the ephemeral Field River in the Simpson Desert, central Australia, as a case study to quantify how resources and habitat characteristics vary spatially and temporally along the riparian corridor. Levels of moisture and nutrients were greater in the clay-dominated soils of the riverine corridor than in the surrounding sand dunes, as were cover values of trees, annual grasses, other annual plants and litter; these resources and habitat features were also greater near the main catchment area than in the distal reaches where the river channel runs out into extensive dune fields. These observations confirm that the riverine corridor is more productive than the surrounding desert, and support the idea that it may act as a refuge or as a channel for the ingress of peri-desert species. However, the work also demonstrates that species diversity of invertebrates and plants is not higher within the river corridor; rather, it is driven by rainfall and the accompanying increase in annual plants following a rain event. Further research is required to identify the biota that depend upon these resource pulses.",PLOS ONE,8,10,,,,e72690,10.1371/journal.pone.0072690,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000325489100003

We classified the studied streams according to their long-term aquatic regime into the three following types: (i) permanent (P), (ii) intermittent with summer pools (I-P), and (iii) intermittent with summer dry channels (I-D). For each stream type, we analyzed taxonomic and trait diversity, as well as the composition of the macroinvertebrate community, following a spatially nested design at three spatial scales of analysis: microhabitat (substratum patches), mesohabitat (pools vs. riffles), and macrohabitat (streams). In order to assess intrinsic seasonal variability in streams from the Mediterranean region, 20 Surber samples were taken from each stream according to meso-and microhabitat frequency in the wet and the dry season during 2010. Given the need for adaptation to specific hydrological conditions and the fact that microhabitats should encompass the niche requirements of particular taxa, we hypothesized that this spatial scale would have a greater influence on macroinvertebrate taxa composition and biological traits than the other two larger spatial scales in intermittent streams. We observed that patterns in the relative importance of variance components across hierarchical spatial scales changed with time because low flow or droughts altered both mesohabitat prevalence and microhabitat composition. Our results confirm the importance of the microhabitat scale in I-P streams in the wet season but not in the dry one, when a loss of microhabitat diversity occurred. Stream-to-stream variability was more important in P and I-D streams. Our study also explored the relationships between traits and aquatic regimes. We found that aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting permanent streams exhibited traits related to the longer duration of life cycles in these rivers (e. g. large size of adult stages) and adaptations to flowing conditions (e. g. modes of aquatic dispersal), whereas aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting intermittent streams with summer pools had traits adapted to depositional conditions and ecological preferences for confined habitats (i. e. disconnected pools without flow). Finally, aquatic macroinvertebrates from intermittent streams with summer dry channels had adaptations conferring ability to survive periods with no water (e. g. modes of aerial dispersal, resistant stages).

Despite no effect on water characteristics, dams decreased leaf litter breakdown rates. Abundance and biomass of invertebrates and shredders and hyphomycete sporulation rates did not differ between upstream and downstream bags. However, the structure of invertebrate and hyphomycete assemblages did. Especially evident was a drop in limnephilids, which might explain the slower breakdown of leaf litter below dams.

In parts of the Middle East, ephemeral rivers (wadis) are characterised by stands of acacia trees. Green, flourishing assemblages of these trees are in decline in several countries, most likely due to human-induced water stress and habitat changes. We examined the importance of healthy acacia stands for bats and their arthropod prey in comparison to other natural and artificial habitats available in the Arava desert of Israel. We assessed bat activity and species richness through acoustic monitoring for entire nights and concurrently collected arthropods using light and pit traps. Dense green stands of acacia trees were the most important natural desert habitat for insectivorous bats. Irrigated gardens and parks in villages and fields of date palms had high arthropod levels but only village sites rivalled acacia trees in bat activity level. We confirmed up to 13 bat species around a single patch of acacia trees; one of the richest sites in any natural desert habitat in Israel. Some bat species utilised artificial sites; others were found almost exclusively in natural habitats. Two rare species (Barbastella leucomelas and Nycteris the baica) were identified solely around acacia trees. We provide strong evidence that acacia trees are of unique importance to the community of insectivorous desert-dwelling bats, and that the health of the trees is crucial to their value as a foraging resource. Consequently, conservation efforts for acacia habitats, and in particular for the green more densely packed stands of trees, need to increase to protect this vital habitat for an entire community of protected bats.",PLOS ONE,8,2,,,,e52999,10.1371/journal.pone.0052999,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000315159200003

Temporary freshwater ecosystems regularly experience dry periods, which constrain the availability of suitable habitats. Current and future threats (e. g. water extraction and climate change) can exacerbate the negative effects of drying conditions. This could compromise the persistence of a large proportion of global freshwater biodiversity, so the identification and protection of refugia seems an urgent task.Location Northern Australia.Methods We demonstrate a new approach to identify and prioritize the selection of refugia and apply it to the conservation of freshwater fish biodiversity. We identified refugia using estimates of water residency time derived from satellite imagery and used a systematic approach to prioritize areas that provide all the fish species inhabiting the catchment with access to a minimum number of refugia while maximizing the length of stream potentially accessible for recolonization after the dry period. These priority refugia were locked into a broader systematic conservation plan with area-based targets and direct connectivity. We accounted for current threats during the prioritization process to ensure degraded areas were avoided, thus maximizing the ecological role of priority refugia.Results Priority refugia were located in lowland reaches, where the incidence of threats was less prominent in our study area and headwaters in good condition. An additional set of 106 planning units (6500 km(2)) were required to represent 10% of each species' distribution in the broad conservation plan. A hierarchical management zoning scheme was applied to demonstrate how these key ecological features could be effectively protected from the major threats caused by aquatic invasive species and grazing.Main conclusions This new approach to identifying priority refugia and incorporating them into the conservation planning process in a systematic way would help enhance the resilience of freshwater biodiversity in temporary systems.",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,19,8,,1031,1042,,10.1111/ddi.12082,,,,,,1366-9516,,WOS:000321444900015

Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,59,75,,10.1007/s10750-012-1387-3,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400004

We also tested the effect of summer drought on the denitrification process. We approached these objectives by estimating sediment denitrification (using the acetylene inhibition technique) in two temporary Mediterranean streams following an increased natural water salinity and agricultural gradient under pre- and post-drought conditions. During the pre-drought conditions, the water NO3 (-)-N concentration was the main predictor of denitrification rates. Together with the water NO3 (-)-N concentration, sediment redox conditions and water salinity appeared to be significant predictors, the latter showing a negative effect. During the post-drought, denitrification rates dropped significantly in both streams and no abiotic factors seemed to significantly influence this process. Our results suggest that high water salinity and drought affected negatively the stream-denitrifying capacity.

M.",Hydrologic controls of physical and ecological processes in Namib Desert ephemeral rivers: Implications for conservation and management,"Ephemeral rivers have been largely excluded from previous attempts to classify global hydrologic regimes, or to assess the role of hydrologic characteristics in regulating ecological processes and patterns in fluvial ecosystems. The Namib Desert's ephemeral rivers are amongst the most hydrologically variable fluvial systems yet described. The coefficient of variation for mean annual runoff (CVMAR) among 28 stations, representing 7 Namib rivers, averages 1.55, compared with a global mean of similar to 0.45. Distinct curvilinear relationships exist among hydrologic characters and longitudinal position along the rivers. In particular, peak discharge, annual flow volume, and days of flow per annum exhibit a marked decline in the lower reaches of the rivers, after a mid-catchment peak. These longitudinal gradients exert strong controls over the composition of vegetation, invertebrate, and fungal communities; the availability and structure of various micro-habitats; and the rates of ecological processes such as decomposition. Flood pulses, although variable in their timing and magnitude, play a critical role in regulating organic matter transport and deposition, and primary and secondary production. Despite the tolerance of the biota to harsh and variable abiotic conditions, these ecosystems are highly sensitive to hydrologic alterations as water is acutely limiting for many organisms and ecological processes.

Fish,2013,"Jellyman, Phillip G.; Booker, Doug J.; McIntosh, Angus R.",Quantifying the direct and indirect effects of flow-related disturbance on stream fish assemblages,"Flood-related disturbances are predicted to be seriously altered by climate change effects, and this will have strong implications for stream communities. Predicting how and why community structure responds to changes in disturbance regimes will require measures of disturbance that are closely linked to community variability. A range of disturbance measures have been tested for their ability to explain patterns in stream periphyton and invertebrate assemblages, but assessments of fish have largely focussed on flow measures as predictors. Consequently, the mechanisms driving fish assemblage responses to disturbance are poorly known. Stream disturbance was quantified using seven measures, three based on disturbance of the streambed (assessed using painted tracer particles), three associated with variation in stream discharge and one from a subjective measure of stream channel stability. Twenty streams were sampled on five occasions to evaluate which disturbance measure explained the most variation in fish assemblages and also to quantify the influence of disturbance on spatial and temporal assemblage variability. To determine whether disturbance affected fish directly or via its effect on benthic food supply (i.e. stream invertebrates), a one-off survey of 52 streams was conducted. Path analysis on data from the 20 streams indicated that fish biomass responded most strongly to flow-mediated bed movement, not flow variability. Consequently, bed-movement measures were better predictors of spatial and temporal variability in fish biomass and assemblage structure than purely hydrological measures. Furthermore, variations in fish biomass and assemblage structure were higher in more disturbed streams. A second path analysis conducted on data from the 52 stream survey compared the effects of physical habitat and food-related components of bed disturbance on fish biomass. It indicated that both had a similar influence on disturbance-related reductions in fish biomass. These results indicate that variation in fish assemblages can best be understood by measuring or predicting bed movement, because bed disturbance is likely to encompass more effectively major factors that influence stream fish, such as habitat availability and food supply. A shift in disturbance regime is likely to change the biomass of fish a habitat can support and fish assemblage structure.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,12,,2614,2631,,10.1111/fwb.12238,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000326021800014

Wendell",Riparian buffer located in an upland landscape position does not enhance nitrate-nitrogen removal,"Relatively narrow (<50 m) riparian buffers strategically reestablished in correct landscape positions have been shown to significantly reduce agricultural non-point source pollution to streams. Because of this, conservation programs have been established to encourage landowners to enroll lands near surface waters to improve water quality. Former cropland enrolled in a conservation program was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in reducing nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) in shallow groundwater. This conservation buffer (CB) was up to 80 m wide and was planted with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). It was situated upslope of an existing 30-60 m wide riparian hardwood forest buffer (EHB) located within the floodplain of an intermittent stream. Shallow groundwater NO3--N, groundwater hydrology, total organic carbon, and soil redox potential were measured throughout both the CB and the EHB for 18 months. Groundwater NO3--N concentrations, often 5-15 mg L-1 within the CB, were not significantly reduced from concentrations that entered from the agricultural field edge. However, a decrease in NO3--N concentration was observed within the EHB (17-83%). The hydrology of the CB coupled with relatively low organic carbon contributed to a low denitrification potential and lack of NO3--N reduction compared with the EHB. While the CB enrollment likely provided additional habitat benefits it did not appear to provide treatment of groundwater NO3--N. It is our conclusion that landscape position is a more important defining variable for buffer site selection than buffer width if NO3--N reduction is a primary goal. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian and in-channel vegetation functions as a roughness element and dissipates flow energy, maintaining stable channel geometry. Ash Creek, a tributary of the Bad River in western South Dakota contains a high proportion of incised channels, remnants of historically high grazing pressure. Best management practices (BMP), including off-stream watering sources and cross fencing, were implemented throughout the Bad River watershed during an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 319 effort to address high sediment loads. We monitored prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) establishment within stream channels for 16 yr following BMP implementation. Photos were used to group stream reaches (n=103) subjectively into three classes; absent (estimated <5% cover; n=64), present (estimated 5-40% cover; n=23), and dense (estimated >40% cover; n=16) based on the relative amount of prairie cordgrass during 2010 assessments of ephemeral channels.

However, the supporting evidence is unclear, especially regarding the survival of hyporheic refugees and their contribution to the recovery of post-disturbance populations. Moreover, few studies have focused on the importance of the hyporheic refuge for aquatic vertebrates such as fish. In this study, we present evidence that the hyporheic zone acts as a refuge for a small benthic fish (Cobitis shikokuensis) following surface drying in an intermittent river. We examined its survival during and recolonization after dry periods by direct hyporheic sampling and mark-and-recapture surveys. When the streambed dried, hyporheic sampling was conducted 58 times across 33 locations in the intermittent reach and 31 individuals of C. shikokuensis were captured from extracted hyporheic water. Mark-and-recapture surveys revealed that recolonizers after re-wetting included C. shikokuensis individuals that had survived dry periods in the hyporheic refuge. The condition factor of C. shikokuensis significantly declined after dry periods, suggesting that most recolonizers suffered from physiological stress, probably within the hyporheic refuge. These results clearly support the long-debated, hyporheic refuge hypothesis, and provide a striking example of the critical role of the hyporheic zone in population maintenance of lotic organisms.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,75,3,,425,431,,10.1007/s00027-013-0289-4,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000323901900008

The ecological roles of ephemeral systems are rarely studied. This paper describes movement patterns of fish in the Mulligan River, an ephemeral system in the Lake Eyre Basin, central Australia. Several sites were sampled along a temporal gradient encompassing floods and dry periods. After a single major flood in 2007 up to seven fish species were found at sites up to 300km from the closest permanent waterhole. Following a series of floods (when waterholes were replenished and remained wet between 2009 and 2011) a further five species were recorded including the first records for the Lake Eyre hardyhead, Craterocephalus eyresii, from the rivers of far western Queensland. The presence of all species known from the parent catchment (the Georgina, where permanent waterholes occur) in the ephemeral catchment (the Mulligan) suggests that many fish species present in the river systems of central Australia are capable of dispersing long distances following the opening of movement pathways during flooding. However, two distinct groups of species were identified: extreme dispersing species, that move as far as possible into intermittently wetted habitats, and conservative dispersing species, that do not move as far, tending to inhabit deeper waterholes within mid-reaches of the river that are more likely to hold water for longer. Preservation of the natural flow regime of Australia's arid-zone rivers is important for maintaining these fish communities and facilitating study of their adaptations to ephemerality.",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,38,7,SI,798,808,,10.1111/aec.12075,,,,,,1442-9985; 1442-9993,,WOS:000326146600007
"Invertebrate, Biogeochemistry",2013,"Larned, Scott T.; Datry, Thibault","Flow variability and longitudinal patterns in parafluvial water chemistry, aquatic invertebrates and microbial activity","1. Parafluvial zones occur in emergent gravel bars and other river sediment structures where exchange with surface water is limited to horizontal inflow and outflow. Within parafluvial zones, interstitial water flows down longitudinal flowpaths in response to hydraulic-head gradients. Changes in physical and biogeochemical conditions along these flowpaths lead to the formation of longitudinal gradients in solute concentrations, biota and microbial activity. The influence of river-flow variability on interstitial residence times, flowpath sizes and solute influx suggests that flow variability also affects longitudinal gradients in parafluvial zones.2. We studied associations between longitudinal gradients and flow variation in the forms of flow fluctuations and variable water sources. We used data from parafluvial zones in a New Zealand river to test four predictions: (i) longitudinal gradients in solutes, invertebrates and microbial activity are steeper in runoff-dominated losing and neutral reaches compared with groundwater-dominated gaining reaches; (ii) moderate-to-large floods eliminate longitudinal gradients, which reform during recessions; (iii) between floods, gradients in parafluvial chemistry change in steepness and direction in response to changes in river-flow levels; and (iv) between floods, invertebrate abundance and diversity are positively related to river flow.3. In Study 1, we measured solute concentrations, invertebrate composition and microbial activity over a range of flow levels in vegetated gravel bars with contrasting water sources (alluvial groundwater in a gaining reach, and hillslope runoff in losing and neutral reaches). In Study 2, we made repeated measurements in unvegetated gravel bars before and after a one-in-2-year flood to assess its effects on longitudinal gradients in nutrients and invertebrate communities.4. In Study 1, we detected gradients along parafluvial flowpaths in NO3-, dissolved reactive phosphorus and major ion concentrations and in pH, electrical conductivity and invertebrate density. There was little congruence between bars in different reaches, or among variables; some gradients became steeper as flow increased, and others shifted from negative to positive or vice versa or approached zero. Parafluvial chemistry was strongly affected by water source; median concentrations of most solutes were 2-20 times higher in the groundwater-dominated parafluvial zone than in the runoff-dominated parafluvial zones.5. Prior to the flood during Study 2, the parafluvial zones were characterised by negative longitudinal gradients in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic N (DON) and positive gradients in NO3-. These gradients were eliminated by the flood, but NO3- and DOC gradients redeveloped during the post-flood period. Differences between the steepness and direction of gradients in Study 1 and the pre-flood period in Study 2 may be related to differences in terrestrial vegetation, as well as differences in flow regimes.6. Associations between river-flow levels and parafluvial invertebrate communities differed in the two studies, which corresponded to different flow ranges. Invertebrate density and taxon richness were positively correlated with flow over a range of low flows in Study 1, but there was no detectable correlation over a range of high flows in Study 2. These results suggest that beneficial effects of flow fluctuations on invertebrate communities peak at moderate flow levels, beyond which invertebrate-flow relationships become unstable.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,10,,2126,2143,,10.1111/fwb.12196,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000323724600011
Invertebrate,2013,"Leigh, Catherine","Dry-season changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages of highly seasonal rivers: responses to low flow, no flow and antecedent hydrology","Highly seasonal rivers can experience extended low flow, and often dry, periods. Macroinvertebrate and flow data were used to explore hypotheses on the effects of antecedent hydrology and the low-flow, dry-season period on macroinvertebrate assemblages in northern Australia. Composition differed between early and late dry seasons. Taxa were more sensitive to water quality and more rheophilous in the early dry season when their habitats were lotic than when habitats later became lentic. As flow magnitudes in the antecedent dry season and on the sampling day increased, the habitats became more oxygenated and, in turn, macroinvertebrate richness increased. Higher wet-season flow magnitudes, flow variability and rates of fall were correlated with lower richness in the following dry season. Alteration of the flow-disturbance regime that increases the likelihood of flow cessation in macroinvertebrate habitats, or extends the duration of the dry season beyond that previously experienced in these highly seasonal systems, may alter the resistance and resilience of assemblages such that the seasonal decline and recovery of biodiversity may no longer be so reliable. Given the projected increase in low-flow incidence in many regions of the world, future research needs to examine the effects of reduced flow, flow cessation and stream drying as multiple, interacting stressors on stream biota.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,703,1,,95,112,,10.1007/s10750-012-1347-y,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000312782000008

In the wet-dry tropics, important subsidies from rivers to riparian-zone consumers are expected in the dry season but may vary depending on riparian zone condition. We investigated the potential subsidy of aquatic fauna to consumers in riparian zones in 2 highly seasonal rivers in Australia's wet-dry tropics. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of invertebrate predators in riparian zones were closely aligned with aquatic invertebrates and emergent adult insects. Further, a considerable proportion (40-50%) of the observed vertebrate fauna in riparian zones were consumers of aquatic fauna, which included fish, crustaceans, invertebrates, and flying adult insects with aquatic larval stages. For hydrologically disconnected waterbodies, estimates of potential insect emergence and the proportion of vertebrate species (in riparian zones) that consume these insects both increased as indicators of riparian plant regeneration and condition improved. Our findings suggest that aquatic fauna provide important subsidies to terrestrial-zone consumers (both invertebrates and vertebrates) during the dry season, and that these transfers can be moderated by riparian zone condition. The wide home and foraging ranges of some consumers also suggest that the importance of these subsidies may extend far beyond the waterbody of origin. Human activities and climate-driven alteration of flow regimes and riparian zones that reduce the availability of dry-season waterbodies or degrade their riparian zones are likely to have negative impacts on aquatic-terrestrial linkages in these systems.",INLAND WATERS,3,4,,411,420,,10.5268/IW-3.4.620,,,,,,2044-2041; 2044-205X,,WOS:000326246400002
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2013,"Leigh, Catherine; Stubbington, Rachel; Sheldon, Fran; Boulton, Andrew J.",Hyporheic invertebrates as bioindicators of ecological health in temporary rivers: A meta-analysis,"Worldwide, many rivers cease flow and dry either naturally or owing to human activities such as water extraction. However, even when surface water is absent, diverse assemblages of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the saturated sediments below the river bed (hyporheic zone). In the absence of surface water or flow, biota of this zone may be sampled as an alternative to surface water-based ecological assessments. The potential of hyporheic invertebrates as ecological indicators of river health, however, is largely unexplored. We analysed hyporheic taxa lists from the international literature on temporary rivers to assess compositional similarity among broad-scale regions and sampling conditions, including the presence or absence of surface waters and flow, and the regional effect of hydrological phase (dry channel, non-flowing waters, surface flow) on richness. We hypothesised that if consistent patterns were found, then effects of human disturbances in temporary rivers may be assessable using hyporheic bioindicators. Assemblages differed geographically and by climate, but hydrological phase did not have a strong effect at the global scale. However, hyporheic assemblage composition within regions varied along a gradient of higher richness during wetter phases. This indicates that within geographic regions, hyporheic responses to surface drying are predictable and, by extension, hyporheic invertebrates are potentially useful ecological indicators of temporary river health. With many rivers now experiencing, or predicted to experience, lower flows and longer dry phases owing to climate change, the development of ecological assessment methods specific to flow intermittency is a priority. We advocate expanded monitoring of hyporheic zones in temporary rivers and recommend hyporheic invertebrates as potential bioindicators to complement surface water assessments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the spatial and temporal distribution of fish larvae among two seasonal and two perennial tributaries of the Sacramento River, CA, USA during the winter and spring of 2004 and conducted a detailed examination of the distribution of fish larvae in Mud Creek, a seasonal stream, in 2006 and 2007. In 2004, both seasonal streams had higher average water temperatures (19.0 degrees C and 16.8 degrees C) and an earlier initial appearance of fish larvae (early March) than the perennial streams (15.5 degrees C and 13.3 degrees C; late March and early May). One of the seasonal streams (Mud Creek) yielded significantly higher catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fish larvae (1131 larvae per 10m(3), 95.6% of total CPUE) as well as the highest diversity (0.92 compared to 0.09 or less) and species richness (seven compared to two or fewer) among the four streams sampled.

We tested procedures to select reference sites, and quantified natural variation (inter-site and -annual variability) among reference conditions using a macroinvertebrate data set collected from 429 mediterranean-climate stream reaches in the San Francisco Bay Area, California (USA). We determined that a landscape GIS-based stressor screen followed by a local field-based stressor screen effectively identified least-disturbed reference sites that, based on NMS ordination results, supported different biological communities than sites identified with only landscape (GIS) or local (field) stressors. An examination of least-disturbed reference sites indicated that inter-site variability was strongly associated with stream hydrology (i.e., perennial vs. non-perennial flow) and annual precipitation, which highlights the need to control for such variation when developing biological indicators through natural gradient modeling or using unique biological indicators for both non-perennial and perennial streams. Metrics were more variable among non-perennial streams, indicating that additional modeling may be needed to develop precise biological indicators for non-perennial streams. Among 192 sites sampled two to six times over the 8-year study period, the biological community showed moderate inter-annual variability, with the 100 point index of biotic integrity scores varying from 0 to 51 points (mean = 11.5).

This study reports the first C stable isotope measurements for dissolved inorganic C present in ephemeral streams in four dry valleys that flow for four to twelve weeks during the austral summer. One of these valleys, Taylor Valley, has been the focus of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research (MCM-LTER) program since 1993. Within Taylor Valley, numerous ephemeral streams deliver water to three perennially ice- covered, closed-basin lakes: Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, and Lake Bonney. The Onyx River in the Wright Valley, the longest river in Antarctica, flows for 40 km from the Wright Lower Glacier and Lake Brownworth at the foot of the glacier to Lake Vanda. Streamflow in the McMurdo Dry Valley streams is produced primarily from glacial melt, as there is no overland flow. However, hyporheic zone exchange can be a major hydrogeochemical process in these streams. Depending on landscape position, these streams vary in gradient, channel substrate, biomass abundance, and hyporheic zone extent. This study sampled streams from Taylor, Wright, Garwood, and Miers Valleys and conducted diurnal sampling of two streams of different character in Taylor Valley. In addition, transect sampling was undertaken of the Onyx River in Wright Valley. The delta C-13(PDB) values from these streams span a range of greater than 14 parts per thousand, from -9.4 parts per thousand to +5.1 parts per thousand, with the majority of samples falling between -3 parts per thousand and +2 parts per thousand, suggesting that the C stable isotope composition of dissolved C in McMurdo Dry Valley streams is largely inorganic in character. Because there are no vascular plants on this landscape and no groundwater input to these streams, atmospheric exchange is the dominant control on delta C-13-DIC. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We then used a combination of three statistical approaches (comparison of average scores, general linear mixed models, and hierarchical partitioning analysis) to determine the potential relationship between crayfish occurrence and predictors.

Environmental flows may be released to protect stream ecosystems, however there is limited knowledge of biotic responses to flow releases in headwater streams. The aim of this study was to examine post-drying recovery of macroinvertebrate assemblages in regulated headwater streams following small environmental flow releases (0.4ML/day). To determine how flow releases affected macroinvertebrate assemblages, two streams that received environmental flows were compared with other regulated and unregulated streams' that were either perennial or intermittent (some with perennial pools). The two streams that received environmental flows showed progressive increases in taxa richness downstream of the release point over time, and taxa richness also increased over a four week period. The downstream reach of one of the streams receiving environmental flows had an assemblage that resembled those of other perennial streams, while assemblages in the other stream were more similar to unregulated, intermittent streams. Relatively small environmental flow allocations can have positive impacts on invertebrate assemblages in small regulated streams over short time periods (1-4 weeks), indicating their potential benefit for ecological restoration of headwater streams.

Therefore it is necessary to control the wastes accumulated by anthropogenic activities, such as mining, where it is in tailings to be released to the environment. According to the Environment Protection Agency, the maximum value in sediments is 11.2 mg Sb kg(-1) and the Earth's crust average is 0.2 mg Sb kg(-1). In this semiarid area, the drainage basin El Carrizal is impacted with wastes of an abandoned gold mine at the Mining District El Triunfo (MD - ET) which have tailings with 17,600 mg kg(-1) of antimony. In the main dry river (arroyo), the Sb content is between 0.6 and 122 mg kg(-1). This element is transported from the source throughout the fluvial basin to discharge into the Pacific Ocean. In the arroyo mouth we collected one sedimentary core and the sediment from dunes (28.6 - 45.7 and 6.43 - 7.74 mg Sb kg(-1)).

We examined the effects of extrinsic (temperature and year) and intrinsic factors (body size and shoal size) on the daily activity of chub Squalius torgalensis, a critically endangered cyprinid found in the Torgal stream, Portugal. We quantified chub behaviors while snorkeling, using instantaneous sampling of focal individuals, in spring 2009 and 2010. We used Principal Component Analysis to describe individual behavior and assessed competing models relating individual behavior to explanatory variables using Akaike's Information Criterion. Year had a strong influence on chub behavior, with individuals spending more time drift foraging and orienting in 2009, whereas in 2010 they spent more time benthic foraging and cruising. Shoal size did not influence behaviors in 2009, but in 2010 individuals in small shoals foraged benthically and searched with greater frequency than those in large shoals. Individuals increased cruising and decreased searching as they grew in length, but the opposite trend was observed as temperature increased. Our results indicate that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence daily activity of chub, with individual behaviors varying between years, and depending upon shoal size, body size and temperature. This suggests that chub display high levels of individual behavioral flexibility, which may be important for fish inhabiting harsh and highly variable Mediterranean streams. Conservation efforts for this species will benefit by integrating behavioral information into management strategies.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,22,2,,307,316,,10.1111/eff.12027,,,,,,0906-6691,,WOS:000316283000013

Estimating groundwater recharge in arid regions is an extremely important but difficult task, the main reason is the scarcity of data in arid regions. This is true for the Eastern Egyptian Desert where groundwater is used for irrigation purposes in agricultural reclamation along the Red Sea coast line. As a result of the scarcity of hydrologic information, the relation between rainfall and runoff was calculated depending on the paleo-flood hydrology information. Two models were used to calculate the rainfall-runoff relationships for El Hawashyia basin and Ghazala sub-basin. Two computer programs known as Gerinne (meaning channel in German) and SMADA6 (Stormwater Management and Design Aid, version 6) were conjunctively used for this purpose. As a result of the model applied to El Hawashyia basin, a rainfall event of a total of 18.3 mm with duration 3 h at the station of Hurghada, which has an exceedance probability of 5-10 %, produces a discharge volume of 10.2 x 10(6) m(3) at the delta, outlet of the basin, as 4.7 mm of the rainfall infiltrates (recharge). For the Ghazala sub-basin, the model yields a runoff volume of 3.16 x 10(6) m(3) transferred from a total rainfall of 25 mm over a period of 3 h, as 3.2 mm of it was lost as infiltration.",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,69,1,,103,117,,10.1007/s12665-012-1938-y,,,,,,1866-6280; 1866-6299,,WOS:000317425200011

We briefly review the history of theoretical and empirical perspectives on community change, and propose a new framework for viewing temporal trajectories of communities in multivariate space. We used a stream fish dataset spanning 40 years (1969-2008) in southern Oklahoma, USA, emphasizing our own 1981-2008 collections which included well-documented, extreme drought and flood events, to assess dynamics of and environmental factors affecting the fish community. We evaluated the trajectory of the Brier Creek community in multivariate space relative to trajectories in 27 published studies, and for Brier Creek fish, tested hypotheses about gradual versus event-driven changes and persistence of shifts to alternate states. Most species were persistent, qualitatively, across the four decades, but varied widely in abundance, with some having unusually strong reproduction after extreme droughts. The community had an early period of relatively gradual and directional change, but greater displacement than predicted at random after two consecutive extreme droughts midway through the study (1998 and 2000). But, the community subsequently returned toward its former state in the last decade. This fish community is characterized by species that are tolerant of environmental extremes, and have life history traits that facilitate population recovery. The community appears ""loosely stable"" about a long-term average condition, but the impacts of the two consecutive droughts were substantial, and may foretell future dynamics of this or other communities in a changed global climate if disturbance events become more frequent or severe.",OECOLOGIA,173,3,,955,969,,10.1007/s00442-013-2646-3,,,,,,0029-8549; 1432-1939,,WOS:000325819700030

Any alteration of the riparian vegetation may influence litter decomposition and detrital food webs. We evaluated the effect of non-native Platanus hybrida riparian plantations on leaf litter decomposition in Mediterranean streams. The experiment was conducted in six headwater streams; three lined by native riparian vegetation and three crossing P. hybrida plantations. We have characterized the processing rates of alder leaves and the assemblages of shredder macroinvertebrates and fungi. Litter decomposition was significantly faster in the P. hybrida than in the reference streams. Although the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration was higher in P. hybrida, no significant effect was observed in decomposition rates. Differences in decomposition rates reflected the macroinvertebrate and shredder colonization in alder litter, with higher abundance and richness in the P. hybrida streams. However, aquatic hyphomycete sporulation rate was higher in reference streams, suggesting that the variation in decomposition rates is a direct consequence of shredder abundance. Our findings support part of the substrate quality-matrix quality (SMI) hypothesis, which expects that high-quality litter will show increased decomposition rates in a low-quality litter matrix.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,716,1,,5,20,,10.1007/s10750-013-1539-0,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000323249200002

Often the health of freshwater ecosystems depends on maintaining and recovering hydrologic habitat connectivity, which includes structural components related to the physical landscape, functionality of flow dynamics, and an understanding of species habitat requirements for movement, reproduction, and survival. To advance our understanding of hydrologic habitat connectivity and benefits of habitat restoration alternatives we provide: (1) a review of recent perspectives on hydrologic connectivity, including quantitative methods; and (2) a modeling framework to quantify the effects of restoration on hydrologic habitat connectivity. We then illustrate this approach through a case study on lateral hydrologic habitat connectivity that results from channel restoration scenarios using scenarios with different historic and climate-change flows to restore fish floodplain habitat in a med-river, the San Joaquin River, California. Case study results show that in addition to the channel alterations, higher flows are required to recover significant flooded habitat area, especially given reductions in flows expected under climate change. These types of studies will help the planning for restoration of hydrologic habitat connectivity in med-rivers, a critical step for mediterranean species recovery.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,509,525,,10.1007/s10750-013-1468-y,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400021
Fish,2013,"Miyazono, Seiji; Taylor, Christopher M.",Effects of habitat size and isolation on species immigration-extinction dynamics and community nestedness in a desert river system,"Habitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of local and regional species extinctions in freshwater ecosystems. To predict future trends in community composition, and the potential sequence of extinctions due to fragmentation of the river continuum, it is important to understand how habitat size and isolation affect the dynamics of species immigrations and extinctions and patterns of abundance and occupancy. We examined fish immigration and extinction rates, and abundance and occupancy patterns, in relation to habitat isolation, size and variability in the Rio Grande and its tributaries in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, U.S.A. Our results indicated that as habitat isolation increased in tributaries, fish immigration and extinction rates and riverine species abundances decreased. Fish assemblages showed significant nested subset patterns across the study sites, and the influence of habitat size and isolation on the nested subset patterns varied with spatial scale. Certain non-native fish taxa were idiosyncratic, reducing the strength of the nested subset pattern. The high temporal species turnover in connected habitats was related to the movement of riverine fish species between the mainstem and mouths of tributaries. High persistence of spring-adapted species decreased extinction rate in isolated habitats. Increasing the spatial scale of the study system probably resulted in an increased ability to detect dispersal limitation between the mainstem and its tributaries. Large, deep pools decreased local extinction of certain native fish taxa in upstream tributaries. The deviation from the nested subset pattern was attributed to the unique regional occupancy of non-native fish taxa that could be associated with their artificial introduction into this system. Our results suggest that increased habitat fragmentation by human activities can accelerate the regional extinction of certain native fish taxa and the dominance of ecologically tolerant, possibly non-native fish, leading to a decline in regional diversity.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,7,,1303,1312,,10.1111/fwb.12127,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000319946000001

In semiarid riparian areas, hydric pioneer tree species are being replaced by drought-tolerant plant species as water availability decreases. Additionally, introduced omnivorous crayfish, which feed upon primary producers, allochthonous detritus, and benthic invertebrates, can impact communities at multiple levels through both direct and indirect effects mediated by drought-tolerant plants. We tested the impact of both virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) and litter type on benthic invertebrates and the effect of crayfish on detrital resources across a gradient of riparian vegetation drought-tolerance using field cages with leaf litter bags in the San Pedro River in Southeastern Arizona. Virile crayfish increased breakdown rate of novel drought-tolerant saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima), but did not impact breakdown of drought-tolerant seepwillow (Baccharis salicifolia) or hydric Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Gooding's willow (Salix goodingii). Effects on invertebrate diversity were observed at the litter bag scale, but no effects were found at the cage scale. Crayfish decreased alpha diversity of colonizing macroinvertebrates, but did not affect beta diversity. In contrast, the drought-tolerant litter treatment decreased beta diversity relative to hydric litter. As drought-tolerant species become more abundant in riparian zones, their litter will become a larger component of the organic matter budget of desert streams which may serve to homogenize the litter-dwelling community and support elevated populations of virile crayfish. Through impacts at multiple trophic levels, crayfish have a significant effect on desert stream ecosystems.",PLOS ONE,8,5,,,,e63274,10.1371/journal.pone.0063274,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000319654700130

Yet, the C dynamics of wetlands and floodplains are poorly defined and field data is scarce. Air-water CO2 fluxes in the wetlands of Donana Natural Area (SW Spain) were examined by measuring alkalinity, pH and other physiochemical parameters in a range of water bodies during 2010-2011. Areal fluxes were calculated and, using remote sensing, an estimate of the contribution of aquatic habitats to gaseous CO2 transport was derived. Semi-permanent ponds adjacent to the large Guadalquivir estuary acted as mild sinks, whilst temporal wetlands were strong sources of CO2 (-0.8 and 36.3 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Fluxes in semi-permanent streams and ponds changed seasonally; acting as sources in spring-winter and mild sinks in autumn (16.7 and -1.2 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, Donana's water bodies were a net annual source of CO2 (5.2 mol(C) m(-2) y(-1)). Up-scaling clarified the overwhelming contribution of seasonal flooding and allochthonous organic matter inputs in determining regional air-water gaseous CO2 transport (13.1 Gg(C) y(-1)). Nevertheless, this estimate is about 6 times < local marsh net primary production, suggesting the system acts as an annual net CO2 sink. Initial indications suggest longer hydroperiods may favour autochthonous C capture by phytoplankton. Direct anthropogenic impacts have reduced the hydroperiod in Donana and this maybe exacerbated by climate change (less rainfall and more evaporation), suggesting potential for the modification of C sequestration.",PLOS ONE,8,8,,,,e71456,10.1371/journal.pone.0071456,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000323425700053

M.",Intraspecific variation in the growth and survival of juvenile fish exposed to Eucalyptus leachate,"Whilst changes in freshwater assemblages along gradients of environmental stress have been relatively well studied, we know far less about intraspecific variation to these same stressors. A stressor common in fresh waters worldwide is leachates from terrestrial plants. Leachates alter the physiochemical environment of fresh waters by lowering pH and dissolved oxygen and also releasing toxic compounds such as polyphenols and tannins, all of which can be detrimental to aquatic organisms. We investigated how chronic exposure to Eucalyptus leaf leachate affected the growth and survival of juvenile southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis) collected from three populations with different litter inputs, hydrology and observed leachate concentrations. Chronic exposure to elevated leachate levels negatively impacted growth and survival, but the magnitude of these lethal and sublethal responses was conditional on body size and source population. Bigger fish had increased survival at high leachate levels but overall slower growth rates. Body size also varied among populations and fish from the population exposed to the lowest natural leachate concentrations had the highest average stress tolerance. Significant intraspecific variation in both growth and survival caused by Eucalyptus leachate exposure indicates that the magnitude (but not direction) of these stress responses varies across the landscape. This raises the potential for leachate-induced selection to operate at an among-population scale. The importance of body size demonstrates that the timing of leachate exposure during ontogeny is central in determining the magnitude of biological response, with early life stages being most vulnerable. Overall, we demonstrate that Eucalyptus leachates are prevalent and potent selective agents that can trigger important sublethal impacts, beyond those associated with more familiar fish kills, and reiterate that dissolved organic carbon is more than just an energy source in aquatic environments.",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,3,11,,3855,3867,,10.1002/ece3.757,,,,,,2045-7758,,WOS:000325486000016

However, the responses of hyporheic microbial assemblage structure and activity to environmental variables remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of hyporheic zone characteristics on microbial assemblages in three French rivers (Usses, Isere and Drome). For each river, microbial structure (assemblage composition and abundance) and activity were measured at three sites with contrasting environmental characteristics (e.g. effective streambed porosity, oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Firstly, we expected that the structure and activity of the hyporheic microbial assemblage would be significantly affected by the environmental characteristics of the hyporheic zone. We also expected a strong relationship between the structure and activity of hyporheic microbial communities in the Usses River, due to greater spatial heterogeneity (i.e. greater porosity differences between the studied sites) compared with the two other rivers. Our results showed that porosity reduction, greatest in the Usses River, affected the exchanges of flows and energy through the hyporheic zone and, consequently, led to a distinct microbial assemblage composition in comparison with the two other rivers. Significant relationships between bacterial assemblage structure and activity were detected for the Usses and Drome rivers, due to the greater spatial variability in sediment and physicochemical variables observed in these two rivers than in the Isere. Hyporheic zone characteristics (sediment permeability, water chemistry, particulate organic matter) appear to be the key factors controlling microbial structure and activity in riverine environments. As the hyporheic zone is essential for biogeochemical processes, including those attenuating pollution, a better quantification of the influences of environmental factors controlling microbial activity is needed to understand and predict ecosystem processes in the hyporheic zone.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,12,,2567,2583,,10.1111/fwb.12233,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000326021800011

These trends are expected to differ among climatic regions but little information exists concerning long-term variability within a particular climate region. We analysed the long-term (14-year time span) patterns in species richness and composition of aquatic insects (EPT: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) in relation to changes in temperature, precipitation and discharge in two reference streams in Catalonia (north-east Spain). Our study sites were located in the Mediterranean macroclimate region but in different mesoclimatic areas, one in the Wet Mediterranean climate area and the other in the Dry Mediterranean climate area (WM and DM, respectively). At the macroclimate scale, precipitation decreased and the frequency of drought events increased during the 14-year period. Although the mean number of taxa in each of the two sites remained similar, there was a replacement of species characteristic of riffle-like conditions by species characteristic of pool-like conditions over time in both sites. EPT composition differed between sites at the mesoclimate scale, demonstrating the importance of regional factors. In particular, changes in EPT composition were less variable in WM than in DM both in the short term and in the long term, indicating that the WM site was less constrained by climate than the DM site. Such differences between mesoclimates are related to differences in flood magnitude (higher in WM) and drought frequency (more frequent in DM) as well as local hydromorphological differences. Our findings indicate that the streams responded similarly to long-term patterns in large-scale variables (i.e. those affecting the overall macroclimatic region), but differed with respect to the effect of local-scale variables (i.e. those differentially affecting each mesoclimatic area).

We examined how delta N-15 of different PUC types relate to delta N-15 of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species (nitrate and ammonium) and to the stream nutrient concentrations in which they grow. We selected 25 reaches located across the fluvial network of La Tordera catchment (NE Spain, 868.5 km(2)), encompassing a gradient of human pressures from headwaters to the river valley. delta N-15-PUC variability was mostly explained by location within the fluvial network and was strongly related to the delta N-15 of DIN species, especially of ammonium. Models were stronger for PUCs growing within the stream channel and thus using streamwater as their main source of nutrients. Regression models including nutrient concentrations improved the prediction power for delta N-15-PUCs, suggesting that nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry cannot be ignored in explaining the natural abundance of nitrogen isotopes in PUCs.

Assessment,2013,"Philipp, Andy; Grundmann, Jens",Integrated Modeling System for Flash Flood Routing in Ephemeral Rivers under the Influence of Groundwater Recharge Dams,"Flash floods in ephemeral rivers are characterized by pronounced runoff dynamics, rapidly rising hydrographs, and infiltration through permeable river beds. In numerous countries, this infiltrationwhich is commonly referred to as transmission lossis artificially increased by means of dams to promote groundwater recharge of local aquifers. However, flow dynamics are significantly altered by dam operation, i.e.,initially pronounced process dynamics are reduced and standing/receding wave effects may occur in downstream river sections. For the adequate portrayal of such flow processes, this paper develops an integrated modeling system for flow routing in ephemeral rivers with groundwater recharge dams. The proposed system is based on a process-oriented description of flow, infiltration, and reservoir evaporation and allows for a robust application under a limited data situation, as usually encountered in arid and semiarid regions. Particularly, the proposed framework accounts for (1)the considerable loss of mass and momentum from the weakly dynamic flow downstream of a dam, attributable to transmission losses; (2)the transient character of transmission losses, which are nonlinearly depending on time and changing channel flow conditions; and (3)circumvents any numerical inconveniences associated with the modeling of dam release flow over initially dry beds by employing an analytical solution procedure of the governing flow equations. Following a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, relevant process parameters are estimated and the modeling system is applied for Wadi Ma'awil, Northern Oman. The application demonstrates both the system's accurateness and robustness for flash flood routing under transmission losses along the wadi, where a recharge dam causes strong flow retention. Therefore, the proposed modeling system can aid in deriving potential groundwater recharge rates, which is of high importance for a sound water resources assessment in the study area.

The highest crab densities occurred in September (2.7 ind trap(-1)), followed by June (2.3 ind trap(-1)) and July (2.1 ind trap(-1)); while the lowest were obtained in November and February, possibly due to the erosive effect of the current during the rainy season. No significant differences in the abundance and diet between pools were found. During the period from June to November it was found that the most abundant item in the crab diet was the plant detritus, with an average of 68%, followed by animal matter (fish remains), 50% on the average, and amorphous vegetal detritus with 14%.

Although desiccation of streams is common in Mediterranean regions, phases of dryness in headwaters have been observed more often and for longer periods in extended temperate regions, including Central Europe, reflecting global climate change and enhanced water withdrawal. The effects of desiccation and rewetting on the bacterial community composition and extracellular enzyme activity, a key process in the carbon flow of streams and rivers, were investigated in a typical Central European stream, the Breitenbach (Hesse, Germany). Wet streambed sediment is an important habitat in streams. It was sampled and exposed in the laboratory to different drying scenarios (fast, intermediate, slow) for 13 weeks, followed by rewetting of the sediment from the fast drying scenario via a sediment core perfusion technique for 2 weeks. Bacterial community structure was analyzed using CARD-FISH and TGGE, and extracellular enzyme activity was assessed using fluorogenic model substrates. During desiccation the bacterial community composition shifted toward composition in soil, exhibiting increasing proportions of Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria and decreasing proportions of Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria. Simultaneously the activities of extracellular enzymes decreased, most pronounced with aminopeptidases and less pronounced with enzymes involved in the degradation of polymeric carbohydrates. After rewetting, the general ecosystem functioning, with respect to extracellular enzyme activity, recovered after 10 to 14 days. However, the bacterial community composition had not yet achieved its original composition as in unaffected sediments within this time. Thus, whether the bacterial community eventually recovers completely after these events remains unknown. Perhaps this community undergoes permanent changes, especially after harsh desiccation, followed by loss of the specialized functions of specific groups of bacteria.",PLOS ONE,8,12,,,,e83365,10.1371/journal.pone.0083365,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000329117900033
Fish,2013,"Power, Mary E.; Holomuzki, Joseph R.; Lowe, Rex L.",Food webs in Mediterranean rivers,"River food webs are subject to two regimes of longitudinally varying ecological control: productivity and disturbance. Light-limited productivity increases as channels widen downstream. Time windows for growth, however, shrink as discharge increases, substrate particle size decreases, and the frequency of flood-driven bed mobilization increases downstream. Mediterranean rivers are periodically reset by hydrologic events with somewhat predictable timing. Typically, a rainy winter with high river discharge is followed by summer drought with little or no rainfall and slowly declining river flow. The magnitude and timing of winter floods and severity of subsequent summer drought can vary considerably from year to year, however. Episodic scouring floods or prolonged periods of drought are experienced as disturbances, stressors, or opportunities by river biota. The timing, duration, and intensity of these hydrologic controls affect performances of individuals, distribution and abundances of populations, and outcomes and consequences of species interactions. These interactions in turn determine how river food webs will assemble, develop, and reconfigure after disturbance. We discuss how spatial variation in solar radiation and spatial and temporal variations in disturbance affects river food webs under Mediterranean climate seasonality, focusing primarily on long-term observations in the Eel River of northwestern California, USA.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,119,136,,10.1007/s10750-013-1510-0,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400007

We tested the applicability of several P-index models adjusted to Eastern Mediterranean conditions. On the basis of model structure and data requirements, we selected the Arkansas model and two models with the RUSLE equation and runoff curve number (RCN). Concurrently, we developed a GIS-based Hermon-P model which was designed to simulate rainfall-runoff events representing the major nutrient-transport mechanism in Eastern Mediterranean. The P index values computed by the Arkansas and RUSLE models exhibited low correlation (r(2) < 0.32) with the measured soluble reactive (SRP) and total P (TP), while the RCN model result correlations were somewhat higher (r(2) = 0.53 for SRP and 0.45 for TP). High correlations between the calculated and measured P during rainfall-runoff events were only achieved with the Hermon model (r(2) = 0.77 to 0.9). These high coefficients resulted from avoiding subjective categorization of the continuous variables and using the measured site-specific erosional predictors instead. On one occasion, during the first significant runoff event of the year, the Hermon model failed to predict total P in the stream water (r(2) = 0.14) because of considerable resuspension of stream sediments. Most of the P-index models are based on the perceptual transfer-continuum framework that was developed for temperate agro-catchments; this framework does not consider P resuspension along streams during rainfall-runoff events. Hence, a new set of equations should be added to the P index to account for potential resuspension in Eastern Mediterranean streams at the beginning of the hydrological year.",WATER,5,1,,262,279,,10.3390/w5010262,,,,,,2073-4441,,WOS:000316614300011

S.; Quinn, Gerry P.",Influences of agricultural landuse and seasonal changes in abiotic conditions on invertebrate colonisation of riparian leaf detritus in intermittent streams,"The structure and function of agricultural stream reaches with sparse riparian and floodplain vegetation differ from those of forested reaches, but may be 'reset' as these streams flow through reaches with forested riparian zones. We investigated whether invertebrate colonisation of River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) leaf packs in lowland intermittent streams was influenced by the adjacent reach-scale landuse (cleared farmland or forested reserve) within an agricultural catchment in Victoria, Australia. Further, we examined the influence of seasonal changes in hydrology and associated changes in abiotic conditions on the colonisation of leaves by repeating experiments over two summers and one spring. Across these experiments, there were no consistent differences in the structure of communities that colonised leaves in farmland and reserve reaches. In both seasons, most leaf colonists were collectors and few were shredders in both farmland and reserve reaches. Relative abundances of gastropod grazers were much higher in summer than in spring. The structure of invertebrate communities colonising leaves in the different reaches converged over time when streams flowed in spring, but diverged over time as the streams dried and abiotic conditions within disconnected pools became increasingly harsh in summer. Thus, patterns of leaf pack colonisation were influenced by the regional climate causing large seasonal changes in hydrology, but not by reach-scale landuse. The large-scale disturbances of agricultural landuse across the catchment and a supra-seasonal drought probably contributed to low diversities of invertebrate communities in the streams.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,75,2,,285,297,,10.1007/s00027-012-0273-4,,,,,,1015-1621,,WOS:000316566800009

We review long-term studies of populations and communities of benthic macroinvertebrate and fishes from sites throughout the med-climate region of California and develop generalities that may apply broadly to med-climate streams worldwide. Severe drought may result in community shifts, and alter age-structure in both macroinvertebrates and fishes. Within-year seasonal patterns in macroinvertebrate communities can be influenced by annual variability in flow regimes. Macroinvertebrate biological-monitoring metrics with consistently low intra-annual variability may be especially applicable in med-climate streams, as is the use of different temporal windows to describe reference periods to reduce influence of interannual variability on impact detection. Long-term data can be used to develop macroinvertebrate-based metrics that can either show or be independent of climate-change effects. Most macroinvertebrate species are temporally rare in their annual occurrence. Multiple components of natural flow regimes can favor native over invasive fishes.

Assessment,2013,"Rigge, Matthew; Smart, Alexander; Wylie, Bruce",Optimal Placement of Off-Stream Water Sources for Ephemeral Stream Recovery,"Uneven and/or inefficient livestock distribution is often a product of an inadequate number and distribution of watering points. Placement of off-stream water practices (OSWP) in pastures is a key consideration in rangeland management plans and is critical to achieving riparian recovery by improving grazing evenness, while improving livestock performance. Effective OSWP placement also minimizes the impacts of livestock use radiating from OSWP, known as the ""piosphere."" The objective of this study was to provide land managers with recommendations for the optimum placement of OSWP. Specifically, we aimed to provide minimum offset distances of OSWP to streams and assess the effective range of OSWP using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, an indicator of live standing crop. NDVI values were determined from a time-series of Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 20-m images of western South Dakota mixed-grass prairie. The NDVI values in ephemeral stream channels (in-channel) and uplands were extracted from pre- and post-OSWP images taken in 1989 and 2010, respectively. NDVI values were normalized to a reference imagine and subsequently by ecological site to produce nNDVI. Our results demonstrate a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the nNDVI values of in-channel vegetation within 1 250 m of OSWP following their implementation. The area of piospheres (n=9) increased with pasture size (R-2=0.49, P=0.05) and increased with average distance to OSWP in a pasture (R-2=0.43, P=0.07). Piospheric reduction in nNDVI was observed within 200 m of OSWP, occasionally overlapping in-channel areas. The findings of this study suggest placement of OSWP 200 to 1 250 m from streams to achieve optimal results. These results can be used to increase grazing efficiency by effectively placing OSWP and insure that piospheres do not overlap ecologically important in-channel areas.",RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,66,4,,479,486,,10.2111/REM-D-12-00099.1,,,,,,1550-7424,,WOS:000322412900011
"Invertebrate, Fish",2013,"Robson, Belinda J.; Chester, Edwin T.; Mitchell, Bradley D.; Matthews, Ty G.",Disturbance and the role of refuges in mediterranean climate streams,"Refuges protect plant and animal populations from disturbance. Knowledge of refuges from disturbance in mediterranean climate rivers (med-rivers) has increased the last decade. We review disturbance processes and their relationship to refuges in streams in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions). Med-river fauna show high endemicity and their populations are often exposed to disturbance; hence the critical importance of refuges during (both seasonal and supraseasonal) disturbances. Disturbance pressures are increasing in med-regions, in particular from climatic change, salinisation, sedimentation, water extraction, hydropower generation, supraseasonal drought, and wildfire. Med-rivers show annual cycles of constrained precipitation and predictable seasonal drying, causing the biota to depend on seasonal refuges, in particular, those that are spatially predictable. This creates a spatial and temporal mosaic of inundation that determines habitat extent and refuge function. Refuges of sufficient size and duration to maintain populations, such as perennially flowing reaches, sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations, particularly during increasing aridification, where little other suitable habitat remains in landscapes. Therefore, disturbances that threaten perennial flows potentially cascade disproportionately to reduce regional scale biodiversity in med-regions. Conservation approaches for med-river systems need to conserve both refuges and refuge connectivity, reduce the impact of anthropogenic disturbances and sustain predictable, seasonal flow patterns.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,77,91,,10.1007/s10750-012-1371-y,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400005
Fish,2013,"Rolls, Robert J.; Ellison, Tanya; Faggotter, Stephen; Roberts, David T.",Consequences of connectivity alteration on riverine fish assemblages: potential opportunities to overcome constraints in applying conventional monitoring designs,"1. Patterns of connectivity are critical to structuring both spatial and temporal variation in the composition of species populations and assemblages. Water resource development has an important impact on longitudinal connectivity in rivers, and disrupts natural patterns of dispersal of individuals between segments of the river network. Consequently, artificial barriers alter the structure, size and distribution of species populations leading to impacts on aquatic biodiversity.2. Quantitative assessment of the ecological effects of connectivity alteration is necessary to develop effective conservation plans to manage the impacts of anthropogenic fragmentation. Connectivity alteration is a complex environmental disturbance because the potential scale of impact is dependent on the spatial scale at which biota undergo life-history processes such as spawning and recruitment. Few river networks have single migration barriers, meaning that multiple points of fragmentation are present and have potentially interacting effects. Therefore, conventional control-impact' approaches to impact assessment may be inappropriate or confounded. Furthermore, monitoring patterns of fish population or assemblage structure moving through fish passage facilities alone creates a mismatch between the spatial scale of impact and assessment of water resource development.3. This paper uses a case study in subtropical Australia to highlight three potential approaches to increasing inference of the impact of fragmentation by barriers on riverine fish. Thorough understanding of life-history and dispersal ecology of fish is necessary to understand and predict the consequences of fragmentation, and comparing patterns of distribution among species with different migration requirements can identify sources of fragmentation. Monitoring patterns in fish assemblages at both the barrier and river network scale increases the strength of inference of the effects of connectivity alteration and management. Experimental removal of artificial barriers would assist in determining the effect of fragmentation by restoring connectivity. Such approaches would improve predictions of connectivity management and underlying drivers of aquatic biodiversity.

Glenn; Ellison, Tanya L.; Prior, Andrea; Waring, Caroline C.",Fish recruitment in rivers with modified discharge depends on the interacting effects of flow and thermal regimes,"1. Alteration of flow and thermal regimes is a key consequence of human use of river and floodplain ecosystems, and these impacts result from a range of interacting ecological mechanisms. Environmental flow regimes are a management strategy to restore or maintain ecologically important aspects of river hydrology. However, inadequate understanding of the processes that determine the effects of flow on population dynamics of biota hinders the maximum benefits of environmental flows.2. Spawning and recruitment of riverine fish is mediated by temperature, access to nursery habitat and the timing and availability of resources. Differences in population sizes between regulated and unregulated rivers are often attributed to the effect of flow and thermal regime change on population dynamics.3. Dams and extraction of water have altered the flow and thermal regimes of rivers in the northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Combining three studies, we (i) examined differences in the recruitment of fish and patterns of potential prey availability between a regulated and unregulated river, (ii) studied the relationships between patterns of flow and temperature on spawning of fish in two rivers with contrasting regulated flow regimes and (iii) experimentally tested the effects of environmental flow releases in a regulated river on fish spawning and recruitment by comparing patterns over time against two unregulated rivers.4. Comparisons between regulated and unregulated rivers indicated that the significantly lower recruitment of Macquaria ambigua in the regulated river was linked with large differences in available prey. Species-specific differences in the abundance of fish larvae between two regulated rivers indicated that different reproductive strategies determine population-level responses to flow regulation. Finally, the experimental flow releases in a regulated reach during late spring did not result in a change in spawning and recruitment of fish, although influences of antecedent flow and temperature on larval and juvenile assemblage composition were significant.5. These findings indicate that the responses of fish spawning and recruitment to flow regime change and restoration are dependent on the conditions that determine the success of these critical life-history processes. Specifically, key effects of flow regulation are reduced summer water temperatures due to hypolimnetic discharge from dams, and the reduced frequency and duration of low flows. Reduced water temperatures limit opportunities for fish to spawn, and sustained base flows were associated with lower densities of potential prey sources in conjunction with potential flushing of larvae and juveniles, thereby influencing recruitment.6. The benefits of environmental flow programmes can be enhanced if flow regimes are modified to ensure that abiotic and biotic conditions that support persistence of biota are provided. In conjunction with flow pulses and floods, low flows are a natural and ecologically important component of flow regimes, particularly in dryland rivers. Understanding the interactive and mechanistic effects of flow and thermal regimes on population viability and patterns of biodiversity is critical to maximising the value of environmental flows.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,9,,1804,1819,,10.1111/fwb.12169,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000321328800004

The hydrological extremes (droughts and floods) impose direct changes in water availability but also in the quantity and quality of organic matter and nutrients that sustain the microbial growth. This review analyzes how these ecological pulses might determine unique properties of biofilms developing in mediterranean streams. The paper brings together data from heterotrophic and autotrophic community structure, and extracellular enzyme activities in biofilms in mediterranean streams. Mediterranean stream biofilms show higher use of peptides during the favorable period for epilithic algae development (spring), and preferential use of cellulose and hemicellulose in autumn as a response to allochthonous input. The drying process causes the reduction in bacterial production and chlorophyll biomass, but the rapid recovery of both autotrophs and heterotrophs with rewetting indicates their adaptability to fluctuations. Bacteria surviving the drought are mainly associated with sediment and leaf litter which serve as ""humid refuges"". Some algae and cyanobacteria show resistant strategies to cope with the drought stress. The resistance to these fluctuations is strongly linked to the streambed characteristics (e.g., sediment grain size, organic matter accumulation, nutrient content).",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,43,58,,10.1007/s10750-012-1302-y,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000325182400003

Alterations such as dam construction, channel modification, and land cover changes in the drainage basins have led to changes in riverine sediment transport, deposition, distribution, and deltaic subsidence. Two of the most highly engineered rivers in the world are the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system in the United States and the Yellow River (Huanghe) in China. Both have experienced tremendous hydrologic and land-use changes in the past. The anthropogenic changes have caused the Mississippi River Delta Plain to undergo land loss endangering coastal communities and impacting major economies. Even with land loss, the main distributary of the Mississippi, the Atchafalaya River, has developed a prograding delta feature at the man-made Wax Lake Outlet and main stem south of Morgan City, Louisiana. The Yellow River has also experienced many alterations with dams completed over the past 50 years, and agriculture expansion within the drainage basin. This has led to interrupted river discharge and large decline in sediment delivery to the river mouth. In the recent years, wetland loss has been observed in the Yellow River Delta. An understanding of how these two deltas respond to land and river alterations is integral to continued sustainability of environmental, commercial, and industrial capabilities. This study compares over 20 years (1989-2010) of delta development (growth/erosion) at approximately 5-year intervals in these two largely modified river systems using remotely sensed images, river discharge, and suspended sediment yield data to better understand the long-term effect of river alterations on deltaic development.","DELTAS: LANDFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES",358,,,209,217,,,,"Conference of HP1, IAHS-IAPSO-IASPEI Assembly","JUL 22-26, 2013",IAHS; IAPSO; IASPEI,"Gothenburg, SWEDEN",0144-7815,978-1-907161-36-0,WOS:000324149000026

The highly invasive eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) has been introduced worldwide; however, although salinity could limit its invasive success, the influence of variations in water salinity on its population biology has been scarcely studied. The present study aimed to analyse the effect of changes in water salinity on the life history and microhabitat use of a mosquitofish population inhabiting a hypersaline stream subjected to human-caused dilution stress. Dilution process and associated habitat changes, such as increased aquatic vegetation, available food and the spread of invasive riparian vegetation (the common reed Phragmites australis), seem to have favoured mosquitofish proliferation and colonization. Dilution caused an increased somatic condition for all individuals and a higher reproductive investment of males and larger females. This led to greater survival, recruitment rates, and abundance during the period of lower salinity. The species showed changes in microhabitat use which could be advantageous in less saline conditions; for instance, the species preferentially used areas with the presence of P. australis as a refuge, and this pattern increased during the dilution period. These results support the hypothesis that human activity is one of the main forces shaping the colonization and proliferation of exotic freshwater fishes. At least in a Mediterranean context, an increase in mosquitofish abundance and the improvement of its population status could be clear indicators of the degradation of natural saline systems.

It is not possible to control the potential flood hazards by using only technological instruments that forewarn the occurrences or imminence. Additionally, it would be better to prepare flood risk maps so as to delineate the risky areas to educate the administrators and local settlers. The availability of these maps is the key requirement for any urban development that entails land use allocation, identification of dam, tunnel, highway, bridge sites, and infrastructure locations for sustainable future. This paper suggests the necessary steps in flood inundation map preparation after determining the possible flood discharge. For this purpose, a set of critical cross-sections along the possible flood plain are taken in the field with surveying methods and measurements. The calculation of the average flow velocity in each section is calculated according to the cross-section geometric, hydraulic, and material properties. Synthetic rating curves (SRC) are prepared for each cross section, which are very useful especially in arid and semi-arid regions where there are no perennial surface water flows for natural rating curve measurements. All the SRCs appear in the form of power function which relates the flow depth to discharge in a given cross section. It is then possible to calculate the flood depth in the cross section through its SRC. Depending on the cross-section shape, the flood width can be calculated. The connection of a series of widths on a scaled topographic map delineates the flood inundation area. If digital elevation map (DEM) is available, then the SRCs can be integrated with these maps and the flood inundation delineation can be achieved automatically.

T.; Sauquet, E.; Pella, H.; Catalogne, C.",Regionalization of patterns of flow intermittence from gauging station records,"Understanding large-scale patterns in flow intermittence is important for effective river management. The duration and frequency of zero-flow periods are associated with the ecological characteristics of rivers and have important implications for water resources management. We used daily flow records from 628 gauging stations on rivers with minimally modified flows distributed throughout France to predict regional patterns of flow intermittence. For each station we calculated two annual times series describing flow intermittence; the frequency of zero-flow periods (consecutive days of zero flow) in each year of record (FREQ; yr(-1)), and the total number of zero-flow days in each year of record (DUR; days). These time series were used to calculate two indices for each station, the mean annual frequency of zero-flow periods (mFREQ; yr(-1)), and the mean duration of zero-flow periods (mDUR; days). Approximately 20% of stations had recorded at least one zero-flow period in their record. Dissimilarities between pairs of gauges calculated from the annual times series (FREQ and DUR) and geographic distances were weakly correlated, indicating that there was little spatial synchronization of zero flow. A flow-regime classification for the gauging stations discriminated intermittent and perennial stations, and an intermittence classification grouped intermittent stations into three classes based on the values of mFREQ and mDUR. We used random forest (RF) models to relate the flow-regime and intermittence classifications to several environmental characteristics of the gauging station catchments. The RF model of the flow-regime classification had a cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.47, indicating fair performance and the intermittence classification had poor performance (cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.35). Both classification models identified significant environment-intermittence associations, in particular with regional-scale climate patterns and also catchment area, shape and slope. However, we suggest that the fair-to-poor performance of the classification models is because intermittence is also controlled by processes operating at scales smaller catchments, such as groundwater-table fluctuations and seepage through permeable channels. We suggest that high spatial heterogeneity in these small-scale processes partly explains the low spatial synchronization of zero flows. While 20% of gauges were classified as intermittent, the flow-regime model predicted 39% of all river segments to be intermittent, indicating that the gauging station network under-represents intermittent river segments in France.

Assessment,2013,"Stella, John C.; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Patricia M.; Dufour, Simon; Bendix, Jacob","Riparian vegetation research in Mediterranean-climate regions: common patterns, ecological processes, and considerations for management","Riparian corridors in Mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions) are resource-rich habitats within water-limited, larger landscapes. However, little is known about how their plant communities compare functionally and compositionally across med-regions. In recent decades, research on these ecosystems has expanded in both geographic scope and disciplinary depth. We reviewed 286 riparian-vegetation studies across the five med-regions, and identified common themes, including: (1) high levels of plant biodiversity, structural complexity, and cross-region species introductions; (2) strong physical controls on plant demographics and community structure; and (3) intensive human impacts. European and Californian ecosystems were the most represented among the studies reviewed, but Australia, South Africa, and Chile had the greatest proportional increases in articles published since 2000. All med-regions support distinct riparian flora, although many genera have invaded across regions. Plant species in all regions are adapted to multiple abiotic stressors, including dynamic flooding and sediment regimes, seasonal water shortage, and fire. The most severe human impacts are from land-use conversion to agriculture, streamflow regulation, nutrient enrichment, and climate change. Current knowledge gaps and subjects for future research include cumulative impacts to small, ephemeral streams and large, regulated rivers, as well as understudied ecosystems in North Africa, the western Mediterranean basin, and Chile.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,719,1,,291,315,,10.1007/s10750-012-1304-9,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000325182400013

We investigated shallow streambed sediments as a refuge for aquatic invertebrates and survival of invertebrates at high temperatures during the dry period in 3 headwater intermittent streams in New Zealand. Sediments from dry stream beds inundated in the laboratory contained 37 of the 53 taxa found in nearby flowing streams, a result suggesting that many taxa attempt to use the dry stream bed as a refuge during dry periods. Relative abundances of microcrustacea (copepods and ostracods), Gastropoda and Coleoptera (mostly Scirtidae) were greater in rewetted sediments than in sediments from nearby flowing streams, and several Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa were present in low densities in rewetted sediments. All taxa that became active in rewetted sediments, except Hydrobiosidae, Tarapsyche ohs (Trichoptera), Lymnaea (Gastropoda), Chironomini, and Cladocera, were active within a few hours of rewetting. We tested invertebrate survival in rewetted sediments at high temperatures (comparable to near-surface temperatures of dry stream beds in the field) in 2 experiments. In experiment 1, abundances of all major taxa were 11 to 94% lower in warm (air temperature = 30 degrees C, sediment temperatures = 22-25 degrees C for 1 h/d) than in cooler treatments. In experiment 2, abundances of most major taxa except Coleoptera and Acari were >75% lower in warm (air temperature = 37 degrees C, sediment temperature = 32 degrees C for 1 h/d) than in cooler treatments. Mid-summer daily maximum temperatures in the top 5 cm of the stream bed were 35 to 42 degrees C in open pasture, 17 to 19 degrees C under dense forest canopy, and 22 to 29 degrees C under sparse riparian trees.

That environmental degradation remains today and continues to harm agricultural productivity. The rehabilitation of a strongly incised ephemeral stream, 'Spring Creek', in central New South Wales, as an example of what can be achieved readily by landowners, is described. The causes of environmental degradation and the main environmental factors leading to the stream erosion were identified, rehabilitation began and the behaviour of the regime for 5 years within Spring Creek and the adjacent floodplain was monitored. It was found that intrinsically unstable sub-soils and sparse ground cover due to persistent grazing by domestic livestock were the major factors leading to incision. Several physical and chemical properties were found to be the primary causes of the soil's instability.Rehabilitation focussed on stabilising the soils alongside the stream, promoting sedimentation and re-vegetation of the stream bed, with a longer-term objective of increasing the transfer of water, sediments and nutrients between the stream and its adjacent floodplain. The measures, implemented by local landowners, included the provision of in-stream porous rock weirs and the lowering of the grazing pressure on the stream bed and adjacent floodplain. Monitoring in 2007, 2009 and 2011 indicated that sedimentation was substantially faster above weirs than where there were no weirs. The rehabilitative measures resulted in the retention of fine sediment (<0.2 mm) along the stream bed behind weirs.",RANGELAND JOURNAL,35,1,,71,83,,10.1071/RJ12046,,,,,,1036-9872,,WOS:000316295400007
"Invertebrate, Assessment",2013,"Stubbington, Rachel; Datry, Thibault",The macroinvertebrate seedbank promotes community persistence in temporary rivers across climate zones,"Aquatic macroinvertebrates inhabiting temporary rivers are typically described as having low resistance to riverbed drying. However, little research has examined the seedbank' within dry riverbed sediments, which comprises aquatic life stages that survive in dewatered sediments and from which active organisms may develop only after surface water returns. We synthesised published and unpublished data from studies that had experimentally rehydrated sediments collected from dry riverbeds, to establish the importance of the seedbank in promoting macroinvertebrate community resistance. Studies from across climate zones were included, to examine seedbank importance in relation to environmental harshness and, in particular, sediment moisture. We also assessed the importance of the seedbank relative to alternative habitats promoting persistence of the flowing river (FR) assemblage. We predicted that the proportion of the FR assemblage present in rehydrated sediments (RS) would decrease with environmental harshness, due to conditions within the sediments becoming less conducive to the survival of biota. A negative relationship between the proportion of FR taxa present in RS and harshness was observed, and this contributed to a reduction in the compositional similarity of FR and RS assemblages as harshness increased. Significant positive correlations were identified between sediment moisture content and macroinvertebrate community metrics (density and taxon richness) in some systems. Habitats external to the dry reach, which contribute to community resilience, were invariably inhabited by a greater number of FR taxa than rehydrated sediments. However, rehydrated sediments included several FR taxa that were not found in any other habitats during the dry phase, including families of Coleoptera and Diptera. Our results indicate the importance of the seedbank as a resistance mechanism for temporary river macroinvertebrates. With climate change scenarios predicting an increase in riverbed drying, maintaining habitats that facilitate the persistence of instream communities during dry phases is an increasing priority. We identified strong relationships between sediment moisture and taxon richness, and river management and rehabilitation activities should therefore aim to retain moisture in drying sediments, by manipulating parameters such as riparian shading.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,58,6,,1202,1220,,10.1111/fwb.12121,,,,,,0046-5070,,WOS:000318046300011

During droughts, low flows may be accompanied by elevated temperatures, and potential refuges including subsurface sediments and spring-fed headwaters are therefore characterized by hydrological and thermal stability. This study examined invertebrate use of benthic and interstitial habitats (analogous to the hyporheic zone) in a groundwater-dominated, perennial limnocrene spring during a supra-seasonal drought. Although exceptionally high air temperatures occurred as flow declined, environmental conditions in the spring were relatively stable, and refuge-seeking vertical migrations into interstitial habitats did not coincide with peak temperatures. However, maximum benthic abundance of two amphipods (Gammarus pulex and Crangonyx pseudogracilis) occurred shortly after the period of elevated temperatures. It is suggested that this temporary increase in the abundance of these mobile taxa reflected upstream migrations triggered by a combination of refuge-seeking behaviour and thermally-stimulated activity. In addition, the spring provided a passive refuge for many lotic invertebrate taxa. A conceptual model is presented, which illustrates the potential contribution of multiple refuges to invertebrate persistence in drought-impacted ecosystems.",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,182,1,,61,73,,10.1127/1863-9135/2013/0409,,,,,,1863-9135,,WOS:000315824300005

We investigate the biodiversity of the water beetle in the Ichkeul Lake stream system located in Northern Tunisia, with emphasis on the effect of several environmental variables on their assemblage structure. This area is of a great importance since it was included in the list of preserved waterbodies by RAMSAR convention on wetlands, MAB (Man And Biosphere), UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). Consequently, the study of its biodiversity constitutes a required way to better conduct this protection aim. Special attention must be paid to species endemic to North Africa, as all of them require conservation measures. Sampling was carried out over the course of a year. Dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, temperature and turbidity were measured for each study site. Water permanence, velocity, aquatic vegetation and substrate type were considered. The investigated streams showed a spatial heterogeneity in water depth, water velocity, turbidity, mineralization and substrate type, but homogeneity in temperature and dissolved oxygen. A total of 68 coleopteran species were identified from the investigated area, belonging to different chorotypes and phenological categories. The coleopteran assemblage was assessed in terms of four community parameters: abundance, richness (S), diversity (Shannon-Wiener index: H'), and evenness (Pielou index: J'). Species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Sites were arranged into two groups based on their species affinity by non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination on the basis of Bray-Curtis similarity at a similarity of 50%. Principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted the species response to the environmental variables. It revealed the distribution profile of sampled species; on the first axis, F1, a maximum number of variables are projected.

From 2000 to 2012, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted monitoring of native fishes in the Little Colorado River near its confluence with the Colorado River. The primary focus of these efforts was to estimate the spring and fall abundance of native fishes, especially the federally endangered humpback chub Gila cypha. Because humpback chub in Grand Canyon are influenced by operations of Glen Canyon Dam, our efforts provide managers of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program with abundance estimates and trends of humpback chub in the Little Colorado River, the most important tributary in Grand Canyon for spawning and production of this species. From 2001 to 2006, the spring abundance estimates of humpback chub >= 150 and >= 200 mm remained relatively low (<= 3,419 and <= 2,002 fish, respectively), thereafter significantly increasing to highs of 8,083 and 6,250, respectively, by spring 2010. Also from 2000 to 2006, the fall abundance estimates of humpback chub were substantially below those abundances estimated after 2006. In addition, flannelmouth sucker Catostomus latipinnis and bluehead sucker Catostomus discobolus showed post-2006 increases in relative abundance, suggesting a systemwide event occurred that was beneficial to native fishes. Most of the increases of humpback chub occurred during the spring season in the reaches of the Little Colorado River between 5 and 13.57 km upstream from the confluence. Successful production of age 0 year classes of humpback chub may be partially driven by hydrograph dynamics of the Little Colorado River, whereas water temperatures and predation pressures in the mainstem Colorado River likely influence survivorship of native fishes into subadult and adult life stages.",JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,4,1,,163,177,,10.3996/082012-JFWM-071,,,,,,1944-687X,,WOS:000320306700018

They promote organic matter retention, create habitat, and potentially increase stream productivity. The stock of downed wood in a river system is a product of the interaction between wood supply, transport, in situ losses, and retention characteristics of the system. Fire and forest management are important disturbances that influence the amount and organization of stream wood with boom-and-bust periods of recruitment and fluvial transport processes. We examined 1- through 3-order Portuguese streams flowing through 3 common silvicultural systems in southern Europe: forests of cork oak, eucalyptus, and maritime pine. Our data set included 1483 pieces of wood in 27 streams, all of which had experienced extensive wildfires within the previous 6 y. We used binned neighbor-k analysis to assess wood organization (segregated, random, or aggregated). We then used linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate the effects of stream order, forest type, and their interaction on wood volume and organization. The best predictor of wood volume and organization was the interaction between forest type and stream order. Most wood pieces were burned and organization was low, suggesting that arrangement of wood was largely a product of input dynamics rather than transport processes at this time. Potential drivers of across-system variability included vegetation obstructions, wood length:channel width ratios, management actions, and effects of fire. Climate models predict more droughts in the Euro-Mediterranean region in the future, with implications for wood volume, transport, and function as terrestrial vegetation invades intermittent stream channels and plant communities shift from managed forests to shrublands with few trees.",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,32,1,,126,141,,10.1899/12-091.1,,,,,,2161-9565,,WOS:000314670800011

Moreover, these populations are endangered due to the introgressive hybridization with cultured stocks. Individuals from six remnant populations in Western Mediterranean rivers were sequenced for the complete mitochondrial DNA control region and genotyped for 11 nuclear markers. Three different brown trout lineages were present in the studied region. Significant genetic divergence was observed among locations and a strong effect of genetic drift was suggested. An important stocking impact (close to 25%) was detected in the zone. Significant correlations between mitochondrial-based rates of hatchery introgression and water flow variation suggested a higher impact of stocked females in unstable habitats. In spite of hatchery introgression, all populations remained highly differentiated, suggesting that native genetic resources are still abundant. However, climatic predictions indicated that suitable habitats for the species in these rivers will be reduced and hence trout populations are highly endangered and vulnerable. Thus, management policies should take into account these predictions to design upstream refuge areas to protect remnant native trout in the region.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,707,1,,29,45,,10.1007/s10750-012-1402-8,,,,,,0018-8158,,WOS:000316332300003

Fire impacts on med-streams are associated with increased runoff and erosion from severely burned landscapes during storms, particularly the first intense rains. Increased inputs of water, solutes, nutrients, sediment, organic matter, and ash to streams after fires are usually observed for months to up to 4 years. Return to pre-fire conditions is associated with vegetation recovery. Benthic algae, invertebrates, and fish are reduced to low levels by scouring floods after wildfire. If riparian zones are burned, benthic algae increase, and invertebrate communities become dominated by r-strategist species. Fishes are eradicated from reaches affected by intense wildfire and often do not re-colonize quickly because of downstream barriers. In general, med-stream communities appear to be more resilient to fire compared to streams in other ecosystems because of the rapid recovery of mediterranean upland and riparian vegetation and geomorphological conditions (1-4 years in med-streams vs 5-10 years in non-med streams). However, drought or mass sediment movements after fire can prolong fire effects.

To compare the responses of macroinvertebrate communities to wildfire, eight sites were established and annually sampled for 5 years. Two months after fire, the number and abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa were not significantly different from those in control streams, but their composition and functional attributes had changed. As expected, an increase in r-strategy taxa was observed during the year following fire. Above all, macroinvertebrate assemblages responded more strongly to hydrology (previous spring precipitation) than to fire. Drought was found to be an overriding disturbance factor, but macroinvertebrate assemblages showed high resilience. In a climate change scenario coupled with human demand for water, it will be important to study the effects of drought interacting with other disturbances like wildfire (which is in turn driven by drought).",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,98,6,,271,283,,10.1002/iroh.201201618,,,,,,1434-2944; 1522-2632,,WOS:000327601000001

Rambla Salada is a temporary naturally saline stream with an intermittent reach upstream. This stream is an ideal scenario to study the effects of intermittent stream flow on macroinvertebrate community composition and biological traits in a naturally saline Mediterranean stream. This study analysed three sites with different hydrological regimes (one intermittent and two perennials). Flow intermittence exerted low pressure on the macroinvertebrate composition and biological traits which led to the loss of drought-intolerant species and taxa rather than acting as a selective force to promote desiccation-resistant taxa. Macroinvertebrate community at the intermittent site was a subset of the community found in perennial sites, and the presence of flier taxa at this site helped avoid flow cessation. These minor changes have consequences to assess the ecological quality of these saline temporary streams in the context of the Water Framework Directive, given the major differences revealed by some indices between the intermittent and perennial sites as the former obtained lower values due to the presence of few desiccation-intolerant species, which significantly increased the value of those biological indices.

Using markrecapture, we examined movement patterns of southern redbelly dace, Chrosomus erythrogaster, in an intermittent Ozark stream having both permanently connected and temporally isolated sections. Juvenile (6088%) and adult (5583%) residency rates were not significantly different for any markrecapture sample, and movement was primarily within a section for both groups. Ontogenetic differences were detected for kurtosis, distance moved and population spread, with adults exhibiting greater variability in movement, moving more often and further. When considering only adults, there was a significantly higher number of individuals that exhibited intermovement from isolated sections compared with connected sections. In addition, a higher proportion of adults exhibiting intermovement moved to connected stream sections in May and July compared to January and March. Dace exhibited upstream bias in July, with 76% of emigrates moving to an upstream connected section. Although there were no statistically significant associations between the proportion of intermovers from connected and isolated sections and measured water quality and habitat variables, noteworthy trends were observed, and these trends were always stronger for connected sections.

In this study, we examine the impacts of the trophic ecology of non-native fishes on the three species' in the San Rafael River, Utah, USA. We employ a suite of abundance comparisons, stable isotope techniques and size-at-age back-calculation analyses to compare food web structure and growth rates of the three species' in study areas with and without established populations of non-native species. We found that the three species' are more abundant in areas with few non-native fishes present, regardless of habitat complexity. Stable isotope analyses indicate non-native fishes lengthen the food chain by 0.5 trophic positions. Further, the trophic niche spaces of the native fishes shift and are narrower in the presence of non-native fishes, as several non-native species' trophic niche spaces overlap almost entirely with each of the three species' (bluehead sucker and flannelmouth sucker 100%, roundtail chub 98.5%) indicating strong potential for competition. However, the three species' demonstrated no evidence of reduced growth in the presence of these non-native fishes. Collectively, these results suggest that while non-native fishes alter the food web structure presenting novel sources of predation and competition, mechanisms other than competition are controlling the size-structure of three species' populations in the San Rafael River.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,22,3,,439,452,,10.1111/eff.12038,,,,,,0906-6691,,WOS:000319872900010

When data were pooled, there were no significant differences in macro invertebrate assemblages among biotopes, months, seasons or years. Assemblages grouped largely on the basis of hydrological phase. A comparison among macroinvertebrate sensitivity in perennial, ephemeral and seasonal rivers indicated that ephemeral rivers had a higher proportion of insensitive taxa.

"Invertebrate, Fish",2013,"Wesner, Jeff S.","Fish predation alters benthic, but not emerging, insects across whole pools of an intermittent stream","Predation effects in streams can cascade to terrestrial food webs through the flux of organisms that develop in the stream and emerge as adults to the terrestrial system. This emergence subsidizes some terrestrial predators, an effect that generally varies based on the magnitude of the subsidy. Factors regulating this magnitude are relatively well known, but factors regulating the trophic structure of the subsidy are not. I tested the hypothesis that predatory fish in natural stream pools alter the biomass and trophic structure (proportion of predatory adults) of emerging aquatic insects. I created a 13x gradient of predatory fish biomass (4 species of Lepomis sunfish and the minnow Notropis boops; within the range of natural variation) across 10 pools in Brier Creek, Oklahoma (USA). Pool area and substrate composition varied naturally, so I also measured their effect on insects. At the end of the experiment after the stream became intermittent, fish reduced benthic insect biomass but not emergence to the terrestrial habitat. The proportion of predatory insects emerging from pools was positively associated with pool area, but was unaffected by fish density. The best predictor of emergence biomass among pools on any date was the standing crop of benthic insects before fish manipulation, a result suggesting a time lag between measured benthic standing crop in the stream and subsequent emergence. Fish manipulations occurred during the end of peak summer insect emergence, which may have limited my ability to detect fish effects on emergence. My study demonstrates that variation in the timing of predation may constrain the spatial scale of fish effects in aquatic and terrestrial food webs and suggests that pool size can influence the trophic structure of emerging aquatic insects.",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,32,2,,438,449,,10.1899/12-124.1,,,,,,2161-9565,,WOS:000318774500006

Methodologies were developed to compute QMRA mean risks on the basis of water samples exhibiting potentially human infectious Cryptosporidium and E. coil based on genotyping Crytosporidium, and E. coli 0157:H7 presence/absence information paired with enumerated E. coli. All Giardia spp. were considered infectious. No significant pasturing treatment effects were observed among pathogens, with the exception of Campylobacter spp. and E. coil 0157:H7. Campylobacter spp. prevalence significantly decreased downstream through pasture treatments and E. coli 0157:H7 was observed in a few instances in the middle of the unrestricted pasture. Densities of total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli reduced significantly downstream in the restricted pasture system, but not in the unrestricted system. Seasonal and flow conditions were associated with greater indicator bacteria densities, especially in the summer. Norovirus GII was detected at rates of 7-22% of samples for all monitoring sites, and rotavirus in 0-7% of samples for all monitoring sites; pasture treatment trends were not evident, however. Seasonal and stream flow variables (and their interactions) were relatively more important than pasture treatments for initially stratifying pathogen occurrence and higher fecal indicator bacteria densities. Significant positive associations among fecal indicator bacteria and Campylobacter spp. detection were observed. For QMRA, adjusting for the proportion of Cryptosporidiurn spp. detected that are infectious for humans reduces downstream risk estimates by roughly one order of magnitude. Using QMRA in this manner provides a more refined estimate of beneficial management practice effects on pathogen exposure risks to humans. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The samples were monitored for host-specific Bacteroidales markers, Cryptosporidium species/genotypes, viruses and coliphages associated with humans or animals, and bacterial zoonotic pathogens. Ruminant Bacteroidales markers did not increase within the restricted cattle access reach of the stream, whereas the ruminant Bacteroidales marker increased significantly in the unrestricted cattle access reach. Human Bacteroidales markers significantly increased downstream of homes where septic issues were documented. Wildlife Bacteroidales markers were detected downstream of the cattle exclusion practice where stream and riparian habitat was protected, but detections decreased after the unrestricted pasture, where the stream and riparian zone was unprotected from livestock. Detection of a large number of human viruses was shown to increase downstream of homes, and similar trends were observed for the human Bacteroidales marker. There was considerable interplay among biomarkers with stream flow, season, and the cattle exclusion practices. There were no to very weak associations with Bacteroidales markers and bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Overall, discrete sample-by-sample coherence among the different microbial source tracking markers that expressed a similar microbial source was minimal, but spatial trends were physically meaningful in terms of land use (e. g., beneficial management practice) effects on sources of fecal pollution.",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,79,20,,6207,6219,,10.1128/AEM.01626-13,,,,,,0099-2240; 1098-5336,,WOS:000325807200002

However, guidelines generally focus more on impacts to perennial streams than on ephemeral streams. An experiment was conducted to evaluate SMZ effectiveness on ephemeral streams in southeastern Kentucky. Ephemeral SMZ treatments included (1) harvest with no equipment limitation, no forest overstory retention, and use of unimproved stream crossings (noSMZ); (2) harvest with no equipment limitation, retention of channel bank trees, and use of improved stream crossings (SMZ1); (3) harvest with equipment restrictions within 7.6 m of the channel, retention of channel bank trees, and use of improved stream crossings (SMZ2); and (4) no harvest (control). Each treatment was replicated a minimum of three times (n of 3 to 6; 18 sites total) at the subwatershed level (0.75 to 8.92 ha). The improved stream crossing types studied included wooden portable skidder bridges, steel pipe/culverts, and PVC pipe bundles. Water samples were taken during storm flows and were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, settleable solids, and sediment transport rate. Both the SMZ1 and SMZ2 treatments significantly reduced TSS and turbidity over the noSMZ treatment. Water in the SMZ1 treatment exhibited higher TSS and turbidity than the control, whereas the SMZ2 treatment was no different than the control for TSS but higher for turbidity. Use of any improved crossing in ephemeral streams significantly lowered TSS and turbidity compared to unimproved fords. Bridges yielded similar TSS and sediment transport levels as those exhibited by the control but turbidity was slightly higher.",SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY,37,1,,36,44,,10.5849/sjaf.11-041,,,,,,0148-4419,,WOS:000317958000006

Reach and catchment information from 120 sites sampled from 1999 to 2004 were incorporated into tree classifiers for 20 prairie fish species, and multiple criteria were used to evaluate models. Fewer than six models were considered significant when modelling individual fish occurrences at the reach, catchment or combined scale, and only one species was successfully modelled at all three scales. The scarcity of significant models is probably related to the rigorous criteria by which these models were evaluated as well as the prevalence of tolerant, generalist fishes in these stochastic and intermittent streams. No significant differences in the amount of reduced deviance, mean misclassification error rates (MER), and mean improvement in MER metrics was detected among the three scales. Results from this study underscore the importance of continued habitat assessment at smaller scales to further understand prairie-fish occurrences as well as further evaluations of modelling methods to examine habitat relationships for tolerant, ubiquitous species. Incorporation of such suggestions in the future may help provide more accurate models that will allow for better management and conservation of prairie-fish species.",JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,82,5,,1497,1513,,10.1111/jfb.12081,,,,,,0022-1112; 1095-8649,,WOS:000318442100004
Assessment,2013,"Zimmer, Margaret A.; Bailey, Scott W.; McGuire, Kevin J.; Bullen, Thomas D.",Fine scale variations of surface water chemistry in an ephemeral to perennial drainage network,"Although temporal variation in headwater stream chemistry has long been used to document baseline conditions and response to environmental drivers, less attention is paid to fine scale spatial variations that could yield clues to processes controlling stream water sources. We documented spatial and temporal variation in water composition in a headwater catchment (41ha) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA. We sampled every 50m along an ephemeral to perennial stream network as well as groundwater from seeps and 35 shallow wells across varying flow conditions. Groundwater influences on surface water in this region have not been considered to be important in past studies as relatively coarse soils were assumed to be well drained in steep catchments with flashy runoff response. However, seeps displayed perennial discharge, upslope accumulated areas (UAA) smaller than those for channel initiation sites and higher pH, Ca and Si concentrations than streams, suggesting relatively long groundwater residence time or long subsurface flow paths not bound by topographic divides. Coupled with a large range in groundwater chemistry seen in wells, these results suggest stream chemistry variation reflects the range of connectivity with, and quality of, groundwater controlled by hillslope hydropedological processes. The magnitude of variations of solute concentrations seen in the first order catchment was as broad as that seen at the fifth order Hubbard Brook Valley (3519ha). Reduction in variation in solute concentrations with increasing UAA suggested a representative elementary area (REA) value of less than 3ha in the first order catchment, compared with 100ha for the fifth order basin. Thus, the REA is not necessarily an elementary catchment property. Rather, the partitioning of variation between highly variable upstream sources and relatively homogenous downstream characteristics may have different physical significance depending on the scale and complexity of the catchment under examination.

In this study, we compared the swimming performance and related morphology of two Iberian barbel populations from permanent and temporary rivers. The permanent river was characterised by its Atlantic influence with higher water availability and a more unstable and turbulent environment, contrasting with the lower discharge setting observed in the southern Mediterranean ecosystem during most of the hydrological year. Barbels from the permanent river exhibited a higher critical swimming speed (U-crit) associated with a more fusiform body shape, narrower head and caudal peduncle, lower body condition and longer and higher pectoral and dorsal fins, when compared with the population from the temporary watercourse.

However, common water management tools demand common understanding of assessment methods, so quality goals are equally met. Intercalibration of methods ensures the comparability of biological elements across similar geographical areas. Many aspects can influence the outcome of intercalibration: data sampling, treatment methods, taxonomic reliability of databases, choice of metrics for ecological quality status classification, and criteria for selecting reference sites. This study describes the potentials and constraints of the intercalibration of indices using diatoms for assessment of Mediterranean rivers. Harmonisation of diatom taxonomy and nomenclature was based on a previous ring test which took place at the European level. Four diatom indices (Indice de Polluosensibilite Specifique-IPS, Indice Biologique Diatomees-IBD 2007, Intercalibration Common Metric Italy ICMi and Slovenian Ecological Status assessment system) were intercalibrated using data from six European Mediterranean countries (Cyprus, France, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain). Boundaries between High/Good and Good/Moderate quality classes were harmonised by means of the Intercalibration Common Metric (ICM). Comparability between countries was assured through boundary bias and class agreement. The national boundaries were adjusted when they deviated more than a quarter of a class equivalent (0.25) from the global mean. All national methods correlated well with the ICM, which was sensitive to water quality (negatively correlated to nutrients). Achnanthidium minutissimum sensu lato was the most discriminative species of Good ecological status class. Planothidium frequentissimum, Gomphonema parvulum and Nitzschia palea were the most contributive to Moderate ecological status class. Some taxa were discriminative for both Good and Moderate ecological status classes due to low indication and ecological discriminative power but also due to differences in taxonomy between countries. This intercalibration exercise allowed establishment of common water quality goals across Mediterranean Europe, which is substantiated with the ICM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Large dams regulate river hydrology and influence water chemistry, sediment dynamics, channel form and biotic communities. These effects may translate into important changes in river ecosystem processes, especially in rivers naturally subject to strong seasonality, such as those under Mediterranean climate.2. The effects of flow regulation on ecosystem metabolism [i.e. gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)] were analysed by means of open-stream measurements. Organic matter accrual and metabolism were measured in reaches upstream and downstream from large reservoirs in three tributaries of the Ebro River (NE Iberian Peninsula) during three sampling campaigns.3. Dams reduced downstream hydrological variability, dampened floods and increased the duration of interflood periods. Benthic organic matter increased twofold and chlorophyll-a eightfold. GPP increased by 59% on average, whereas ER increased by 75%.4.

Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected monthly (or biweekly) at six different sampling sites from July 2006 to January 2008. Species richness and abundance were extremely low at all sampling sites during the flooding period, but the communities subsequently recovered rapidly within 1month. The effects of floods and droughts on benthic macroinvertebrates manifested differently among the three different stream types. Species richness and abundance had a negative relationship with the amount of precipitation in the perennial stream type, whereas no significant relationship was observed in the ephemeral stream type. A Self-Organizing Map, an unsupervised artificial neural network, classified the samples into four clusters based on the similarities of community composition, reflecting the different effects of floods and droughts on the different stream types. Our results suggest that floods and droughts are the defining characteristics of streams, spatial heterogeneity (i.e. the perennial stream type) can decrease the effect of temporal heterogeneity, and both spatial and temporal heterogeneities are important for structuring the environmental condition and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages.

Invertebrate,2014,"Boersma, Kate S.; Bogan, Michael T.; Henrichs, Brian A.; Lytle, David A.",Top predator removals have consistent effects on large species despite high environmental variability,"Top predator losses affect a wide array of ecological processes, and there is growing evidence that top predators are disproportionately vulnerable to environmental changes. Despite increasing recognition of the fundamental role that top predators play in structuring communities and ecosystems, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of predator extinctions in highly variable environments. Both biotic and abiotic drivers determine community structure, and manipulative experiments are necessary to disentangle the effects of predator loss from other co-occurring environmental changes. To explore the consistency of top predator effects in ecological communities that experience high local environmental variability, we experimentally removed top predators from arid-land stream pool mesocosms in southeastern Arizona, USA, and measured natural background environmental conditions. We inoculated mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from local streams, removed the top predator Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) from half of the mesocosms as a treatment, and measured community divergence at the end of the summer dry season. We repeated the experiment in two consecutive years, which represented two very different biotic and abiotic environments. We found that some of the effects of top predator removal were consistent despite significant differences in environmental conditions, community composition, and colonist sources between years. As in other studies, top predator removal did not affect overall species richness or abundance in either year, and we observed inconsistent effects on community and trophic structure. However, top predator removal consistently affected large-bodied species (those in the top 1% of the community body size distribution) in both years, increasing the abundance of mesopredators and decreasing the abundance of detritivores, even though the identity of these species varied between years. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of large taxa to top predator extirpations and suggest that the consistency of observed ecological patterns may be as important as their magnitude.",OIKOS,123,7,,807,816,,10.1111/oik.00925,,,,,,0030-1299; 1600-0706,,WOS:000337744900006
Invertebrate,2014,"Boersma, Kate S.; Bogan, Michael T.; Henrichs, Brian A.; Lytle, David A.",Invertebrate assemblages of pools in arid-land streams have high functional redundancy and are resistant to severe drying,"Seasonal droughts are predictable components of arid-land stream hydrology, and many arid-land aquatic taxa have adapted to their extreme environment. However, climate change is altering this predictable hydrology, producing longer and more severe droughts and creating novel disturbance regimes for resident organisms. The hydrologic transitions from flowing stream to fragmented pools to dry stream bed are frequently associated with steep decreases in taxonomic and functional diversity, referred to as thresholds of biodiversity loss. Less is known about how taxa respond between these thresholds, as fragmented pools gradually dry and abiotic conditions intensify. While an increasingly extreme environment may be expected to reduce taxonomic and trait richness, species adapted to predictable seasonal fragmentation may be resistant to declining water levels until all surface water is lost. We used aquatic mesocosms to test two competing hypotheses of the relationship between richness and pool drying for arid-land stream invertebrates: (i) the drought vulnerability hypothesis (richness gradually decreases with drying) and (ii) the drought resistance hypothesis (richness remains constant until complete drying occurs). We inoculated replicate mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from arid-land streams in Arizona, U.S.A., and applied three drying treatments representing a continuum of drying stress commonly observed in local streams during the summer dry season (water depths: 10, 7 and 1cm). Mesocosms were covered to restrict dispersal and colonisation processes and to isolate resistance (in situ survival of species) from resilience (community recovery following disturbance). After 45days, we destructively sampled all invertebrates in the mesocosms and calculated various taxonomic and functional trait metrics. Taxonomic richness and composition did not differ between drying treatments, providing strong support for the drought resistance hypothesis. Severe drying was associated with lower invertebrate abundances and higher densities than the moderate and control treatments. This finding suggests that density-dependent processes generated by decreased available habitat may be more important determinants of community composition during droughts than abiotic stress in this system. We observed a near-complete overlap of trophic traits (body size and functional feeding group) and resistance traits (respiration mode and diapause) among the three treatments. This high functional redundancy may provide a buffer against changes to ecosystem functioning, even in cases of severe-drying-induced habitat contraction and fragmentation.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,59,3,,491,501,,10.1111/fwb.12280,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000330779600006

The Santa Maria River, 200km northwest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, lies within the northern range of the federally endangered southern California steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and is a logical candidate for instream flow protection: the watershed historically supported the anadromous life history of this species, but fish must navigate the lowermost 39km of the commonly dry mainstem river to move between the ocean and freshwater habitats in the upper watershed. Mainstem flows are partly controlled by Twitchell Dam, constructed across one of the Santa Maria River's two main tributaries in 1962. The dam is operated to maximize groundwater recharge through the bed of the mainstem Santa Maria River, thus minimizing discharge to the Pacific Ocean and so reducing already limited steelhead passage opportunities. Conventional criteria for determining suitable instream flows for steelhead passage are ill-suited to intermittent, Mediterranean-type rivers because they ignore the dynamic channel morphology and critical importance of headwater flows in providing cues that once presaged passage-adequate mainstem discharges but no longer do so. Hydrologic analysis of pre-dam flows, coupled with established criteria for successful O.mykiss migration, provides an objective basis for evaluating alternative dam-management scenarios for enhancing steelhead passage, although their implementation would redirect some water that for the past half-century has exclusively supported irrigated agriculture and municipal water supplies.

Regulation thereby reduces aquatic habitat downstream of weirs that also form barriers to migration by stream fauna. Environmental flow releases may restore streamflow in rivers, but are rarely applied to headwaters. We sampled fish and crayfish in four regulated headwater streams before and after the release of summer-autumn environmental flows, and in four nearby unregulated streams, to determine whether their abundances increased in response to flow releases. Historical data of fish and crayfish occurrence spanning a 30 year period was compared with contemporary data (electrofishing surveys, Victoria Range, Australia; summer 2008 to summer 2010) to assess the longer-term effects of regulation and drought. Although fish were recorded in regulated streams before 1996, they were not recorded in the present study upstream or downstream of weirs despite recent flow releases. Crayfish (Geocharax sp. nov. 1) remained in the regulated streams throughout the study, but did not become more abundant in response to flow releases. In contrast, native fish (Gadopsis marmoratus, Galaxias oliros, Galaxias maculatus) and crayfish remained present in unregulated streams, despite prolonged drought conditions during 2006-2010, and the assemblages of each of these streams remained essentially unchanged over the 30 year period. Flow release volumes may have been too small or have operated for an insufficient time to allow fish to recolonise regulated streams. Barriers to dispersal may also be preventing recolonisation. Indefinite continuation of annual flow releases, that prevent the unnatural cessation of flow caused by weirs, may eventually facilitate upstream movement of fish and crayfish in regulated channels; but other human-made dispersal barriers downstream need to be identified and ameliorated, to allow native fish to fulfil their life cycles in these headwater streams.",PLOS ONE,9,3,,,,e91925,10.1371/journal.pone.0091925,,,,,,1932-6203,,WOS:000333348500061

We investigated the influence of headwater areas (ephemeral and intermittent) on sediment mobility and downstream water quality using selected water quality parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and pH) within three first order catchments in the Upper Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi, USA. This study included one year of pre-harvest and two years of post harvest observations for ephemeral intermittent streams. Four treatments including two Best Management Practices (BMPs) for ephemeral streams were applied: standard BMP (SBMP) removal of all merchantable stems while leaving understory intact with minimum surface soil disturbance; modified BMP (MBMP) same as SBMP with the addition of logging debris to the drainage channel; Clearcut (CC) total harvest with no BMPs applied; Reference (REF) left uncut as a control. Forest clearcutting in ephemeral intermittent streams resulted in substantial impacts to net erosion/deposition for both channel and hillslope positions and significantly increased total suspend sediment (TSS) within ephemeral intermittent stream channels. There were no significant differences among BMPs and REF in net erosion/deposition and TSS. However, perennial stream water quality did not change significantly among treatments following harvest. Results imply that the impacts of timber harvesting were ameliorated by implementing two ephemeral intermittent stream BMPs during harvesting activities. These findings support the use of either SBMP or MBMP for conserving ephemeral intermittent streams. While the addition of logging debris in the channel of MBMP did not substantially reduce erosion and sediment flux when compared to SBMP, there may be operational benefits to permitting using a natural sediment baffle because it reduces operational constraints allowing for a greater timber yield.",JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY,59,1,,191,203,,,,,,,,0023-6152,,WOS:000333071100030

The present preliminary study explored the perception that fishing reduces the abundance of targeted, large-bodied species that become restricted to disconnected waterholes during the distinct dry season. River sites in the Fitzroy River catchment, Western Australia, could be clearly classified as experiencing either high or low fishing pressure by using metrics of human accessibility'. The abundance of Hephaestus jenkinsi and Lates calcarifer, targeted by both recreational and customary fishers was highly correlated with accessibility and showed a negative relationship with fishing pressure. Non-target species showed no discernible trend. We estimated that 38% of river length remains subject to relatively low fishing pressure. These preliminary relationships suggest that fish harvest can potentially alter the structure of fish assemblages in disconnected habitats. The potential impact of fishing on the sustainability of fish populations is, most likely, greatest for non-diadromous species and will become more apparent with increasing distance from recolonisation sources.

Invertebrate,2014,"Corti, Roland; Datry, Thibault","Drying of a temperate, intermittent river has little effect on adjacent riparian arthropod communities","Rivers and their adjacent riparian zones are intimately linked by fluxes of water, air masses, nutrients and organisms. Intermittent rivers constitute ideal systems to examine these linkages because they are characterised by alternating wet and dry phases, and hence, natural and contrasting variations occur in aquatic resources and environmental conditions.We addressed the effects of river drying on riparian communities by collecting ground-dwelling arthropods at three perennial sites and at four intermittent sites during a wet and a dry phase in the Albarine River (France). We first predicted that during dry phases, declines in aquatic resources and loss of water would create harsh environmental conditions and alter community structure and composition, due to decreases in predators and hygrophilous taxa. Second, we predicted that alternating wet and dry phases would enhance cumulative taxonomic richness over time owing to an increase in species turnover.We found similar decreasing temporal patterns in taxonomic richness and abundance at intermittent and perennial sites, indicating that river drying had no effect on the structure of riparian arthropod communities. Community composition at intermittent and perennial sites differed only during the dry phase, indicating that intermittent and perennial sites gained and lost different sets of taxa as the river dried.

To this end, techniques for transposing information, such as hydrological regional analyses, are widely employed. A method is presented for regionalizing flow-duration curves (FDCs) in perennial, intermittent and ephemeral rivers, based on the extended Burr XII probability distribution. This distribution shows great flexibility to fit data, with accurate reproduction of flow extremes. The performance analysis showed that, in general, the regional models are able to synthesize FDCs in ungauged basins, with a few possible drawbacks in the application of the method to intermittent and ephemeral rivers. In addition to the regional models, we summarize the experience of using synthetic FDCs for the indirect calibration of the Rio Grande rainfall-runoff model parameters in ungauged basins.Editor D.

N.",Broad-scale patterns of invertebrate richness and community composition in temporary rivers: effects of flow intermittence,"Temporary rivers are increasingly common freshwater ecosystems, but there have been no global syntheses of their community patterns. In this study, we examined the responses of aquatic invertebrate communities to flow intermittence in 14 rivers from multiple biogeographic regions covering a wide range of flow intermittence and spatial arrangements of perennial and temporary reaches. Hydrological data were used to describe flow intermittence (FI, the proportion of the year without surface water) gradients. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationships between FI and community structure and composition. We also tested if communities at the most temporary sites were nested subsets of communities at the least temporary and perennial sites. Taxon richness decreased as FI increased and invertebrate communities became dominated by ubiquitous taxa. The number of resilient taxa (with high dispersal capacities) decreased with increased FI, whereas the number of resistant taxa (with adaptations to desiccation) was not related to FI. River-specific and river-averaged model comparisons indicated most FI-community relationships did not differ statistically among rivers. Community nestedness along FI gradients was detected in most rivers and there was little or no influence of the spatial arrangement of perennial and temporary reaches. These results indicate that FI is a primary driver of aquatic communities in temporary rivers, regardless of the biogeographic species pool. Community responses are largely due to resilience rather than resistance mechanisms. However, contrary to our expectations, resilience was not strongly influenced by spatial fragmentation patterns, suggesting that colonist sources other than adjacent perennial reaches were important.",ECOGRAPHY,37,1,,94,104,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00287.x,,,,,,0906-7590; 1600-0587,,WOS:000330744100010

Fish,2014,"Dexter, Tim; Bond, Nick; Hale, Robin; Reich, Paul",Dispersal and recruitment of fish in an intermittent stream network,"Animal movement is an important process connecting habitats in heterogeneous landscapes, and can play a key role in population persistence. Laboratory swim trials were conducted to determine and compare the dispersal capabilities of two native Australian fish, mountain galaxias (Galaxias olidus, Family Galaxiidae) and southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis, Family Nannopercidae) that maintain populations in hydrologically variable and intermittently flowing streams in south-eastern Australia. These experiments showed that G. olidus had significantly greater swimming endurance under a range of flow velocities. Concurrent field surveys were used to establish whether swimming abilities observed in laboratory studies were consistent with patterns of inferred movement from distribution and abundance patterns observed in the field. Data collected at multiple sites from headwater to lowland reaches along multiple streams revealed substantial temporal changes in the distribution of young-of-year (0+) G. olidus, with spawning occurring at upland sites in winter, followed by downstream larval migration and subsequent upstream movement in late spring. Observed spatial and temporal patterns in G. olidus abundances were consistent with a source-sink population structure, which may be disrupted by prolonged cease-to-flow periods during drought years. In contrast, results for N. australis suggested limited dispersal, with restricted local populations that persist at sites with permanent surface water. These field and laboratory findings complement our understanding of the spatial population structure of these two species in intermittent streams, and highlight the importance of understanding the role of dispersal in species conservation and habitat restoration.",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,39,2,,225,235,,10.1111/aec.12064,,,,,,1442-9985; 1442-9993,,WOS:000333189300010

For this purpose, a common database composed of national reference sites (929 records) from seven countries, sampled for invertebrates, diatoms and macrophytes was used. The analyses of reference sites showed that small (catchment <100 km(2)) siliceous and non-siliceous streams were mainly affected by channelization, bank alteration and hydropeaking. Medium-sized siliceous rivers were the most affected by stressors: 25-43% of the samples showed at least slight alterations regarding channelization, connectivity, upstream dam influence, hydropeaking and degradation of riparian vegetation. Temporary streams were the least affected by hydromorphological changes, but they were nevertheless affected by alterations in riparian vegetation. There were no major differences between all permanent stream types regarding water quality, but temporary streams showed lower values for oxygenation (DO) and wider ranges for other variables, such as nitrates. A lower threshold value for DO (60%) was determined for this stream type and can be attributed to the streams' natural characteristics. For all other river types, common limits were found for the remaining variables (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, total P. % of artificial areas, % of intensive and extensive agriculture, % of semi-natural areas in the catchment). These values were then used to select the list of reference sites. The biological communities were characterized, revealing the existence of nine groups of Mediterranean invertebrate communities, six for diatoms and five for macrophytes: each group was characterized by specific indicator taxa that highlighted the differences between groups.

Statistical options and implications,"Within the Mediterranean region each country has its own assessment method based on aquatic macroinvertebrates. However, independently of the classification system, quality assessments should be comparable across members of the European Commission, which means, among others, that the boundaries between classes should not deviate significantly. Here we check for comparability between High-Good and Good-Moderate classifications, through the use of a common metric. Additionally, we discuss the influence of the conceptual and statistical approaches used to calculate a common boundary within the Mediterranean countries participating in the Intercalibration Exercise (e.g., using individual national type-boundaries, one value for each common type or an average boundary by country; weighted average, median) in the overall outcome. All methods, except for the IBMWP (the Iberian BMWP) when applied to temporary rivers, were highly correlated (0.82 < R < 0.98) with the common metric STAR-ICMi. This index was shown to respond well to a variety of pressures (especially local habitat alterations, riparian vegetation degradation, nutrient enrichment and chemical contamination, land use and global degradation; p < 0.00001) affecting Mediterranean streams. However, depending on the statistical approach used, a different number of class boundaries failed the acceptable deviation from the common boundary (a quarter of class width). That leads to a different percentage of national sites failing to achieve good status and ultimately to a different technical and economic effort in the recovery of streams to that condition. We argue that low/high boundaries might have different meanings not restricted to the quality (good/bad) of reference conditions but also to the natural spatial and temporal variability contained in national and intercalibration types. The highly variable hydrological regimes of Mediterranean streams may influence the reference condition and require further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeochemistry,2014,"Foulquier, Arnaud; Dehedin, Arnaud; Piscart, Christophe; Montuelle, Bernard; Marmonier, Pierre",Habitat heterogeneity influences the response of microbial communities to severe low-flow periods in alluvial wetlands,"Microbial communities play a central role in the functioning of freshwater ecosystems, but the impact of severe low flow on microbial processes at the floodplain scale is largely unexplored, especially in terms of patterns in decline of water level. The differential responses of benthic and interstitial microbial communities are also unknown. We explored the structural and functional responses of bacterial and fungal communities to severe low-flow periods at the surface and deep in the sediment of three types of wetland, namely running water, upwelling zones and isolated pools. The different wetland types exhibited distinct microbial communities but the low-flow period induced homogenisation of community composition among wetland types. Despite a convergence in microbial community composition, the response of microbial processes differed among wetland types during the low-flow period: a decrease in biomass and activity in running water and upwelling sites contrasted with an increase observed in isolated pools. Microbial communities and processes deep in the sediment appeared less affected by the low-flow period and wetland type, but were not insensitive. Homogenisation of community compositions at 50cm depth was observed 1month after the low-flow period, suggesting drivers distinct from those at the surface. Our results demonstrate the predominant effect of environmental conditions on rates of microbial processes as opposed to community composition. Wetland heterogeneity, in terms of modalities of water level decrease, seems to be important for the maintenance of microbial processes at the floodplain scale in the context of increasing frequency and severity of low-flow periods.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,59,3,,463,476,,10.1111/fwb.12278,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000330779600004

Such knowledge is necessary since anthropogenic activities continue to alter the natural hydrogeomorphology of large floodplains, with most consequences for aquatic communities remaining unknown. Using information from six large rivers located in four different climate regions (humid subtropical, maritime temperate, Mediterranean and dry semi-arid), we compared benthic macroinvertebrate responses along lateral gradients of hydrological connectivity. We tested hypotheses related to differences among climate regions and to similar hydrological constraints within any one climate. The large geographical scale covered by this study provides the first comprehensive comparison of aquatic community patterns across hydrological gradients under different climatic settings. Multivariate ordinations demonstrated a higher overlap of trait community composition (50% variance explained by the first two axes) than taxonomic composition (15%) among floodplains, displaying high interclimate trait stability. The taxonomy-based ordination separated the subtropical floodplain, with an average 86% of non-insect taxa, from the insect-dominated temperate, Mediterranean and semi-arid floodplains (with >50% insect abundance). In the trait-based ordination, large body size (60% of organisms >4cm) and long lifespan duration (80% of organisms) discriminated the subtropical from the other five studied floodplains. Across a gradient of lateral connectivity, linear mixed effect (LME) models supported seven of 15 hypotheses, which suggests remarkably consistent macroinvertebrate patterns in floodplains regardless of the climate regime. Taxon and trait richness were positively related and peaked at sites of intermediate hydrological connectivity. Our predictions about the feeding guilds of macroinvertebrates (e.g. that shredders and scrapers would be more abundant in connected channels, and predators and deposit feeders at isolated sites) were more strongly supported by the data than those about life history (e.g. plurivoltinism and short lifespan would be better represented in connected channels). This difference was related to the influence of extended periods of hydrological disconnection as disturbance in addition to flooding. Trait stability across hydrological connectivity provides a meaningful ecological context for the comparison of the macroinvertebrate benthos among climatic zones, where taxonomic composition differs strongly. In addition, trait similarities and dissimilarities found in this study suggest that large-scale biogeographical filters do operate on communities, resulting in different trait combinations in temperate and Mediterranean floodplains when compared to semi-arid and subtropical environments. The extent to which global macroecological factors (i.e. climate, dispersal history) and local biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. drought frequency, habitat structure, water chemistry) contribute to this difference requires further investigation.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,59,3,,630,648,,10.1111/fwb.12292,,,,,,0046-5070; 1365-2427,,WOS:000330779600016
Assessment,2014,"Goulsbra, Claire; Evans, Martin; Lindsay, John","Temporary streams in a peatland catchment: pattern, timing, and controls on stream network expansion and contraction","In peatlands, poorly maintained baseflows mean that network expansion during storm events can be rapid and pronounced, resulting in large changes in catchment connectivity. This has implications for the timing and magnitude of material fluxes from these environments, understanding of which is becoming increasingly important due to peatlands' significance as global carbon stores. In this study, electrical resistance (ER) technology has been used to create sensors capable of detecting the presence and absence of flow in ephemeral portions of the channel network. These sensors provide data on the patterns of network variation in the Upper North Grain research catchment, a small peatland headwater in the South Pennines, UK. Networks of around 40 sensors were deployed in autumn 2007 and summer 2008, giving a total of almost four months of high-resolution monitoring data. Drainage density in the catchment was found to vary between 1.4 and 30.0 km/km(2), suggesting significant differences in connectivity between the expanded and contracted networks. Water table depth was identified as the key factor determining the temporal pattern of streamflow at both the site- and catchment-wide scales. Spatially, network expansion and contraction occurred in a disjointed manner, following a similar pattern between events, suggesting that localized controls are important for flow generation. Spatial controls on flow generation relate to local water table levels, and include drainage area, local dissection, channel slope and gully morphology. The importance of water table as the key control on catchment connectivity suggests that potential future change in catchment water tables, associated with projected climate change or with peatland restoration by rewetting, will modify the frequency of full catchment connectivity.

As a result of their hydrological regime, temporary streams are affected by drying and rewetting periods. Drying can alter in-stream nitrogen (N) availability and reduce N processing rates and subsequent retention after re-wetting. We sought to determine if hydrologic drying modifies reach-scale sediment chemical properties and constrains the response of N processing to rewetting. We compared different abiotic characteristics of sediments and nitrification and denitrification rates between a perennial and intermittent reach in the same stream over a wet period, when surface water flowed in both reaches, and a dry period, when the intermittent reach dried up. We analyzed N processing rates by incubating sediments with stream water, thereby simulating a rewetting when sediments from the intermittent reach were dry. We found that drying increased the sediment nitrate (NO3 (-)) content. Conversely, drying did not reduce the recovery of N processing rates to pre-dry levels after simulated flooding conditions. Our results suggest that dry reaches may act as a potential NO3 (-) source by releasing downstream NO3 (-) pulses after stream flow recovery. Given the European Water Framework Directive requirements to assess stream ecological status, these N pulses following rewetting should be considered when designing management plans in temporary streams. Our study highlights the rapid response of in-stream N processing to rewetting period following a drought. This high resilience to process N should be seen as a vital ecosystem service provided by temporary streams despite annual dry periods.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,76,2,,173,186,,10.1007/s00027-013-0327-2,,,,,,1015-1621; 1420-9055,,WOS:000333079100003
Biogeochemistry,2014,"Isabel Arce, Maria; von Schiller, Daniel; Gomez, Rosa",Variation in nitrate uptake and denitrification rates across a salinity gradient in Mediterranean semiarid streams,"Streams are significant locations for nitrate (NO3 (-)) processing within landscapes. This is especially important in dry climates given the limited water availability for biological processes elsewhere. In arid and semiarid regions, many streams are naturally saline. Elevated salinity can constrain the structure and function of aquatic organisms, which is expected to increase worldwide being associated to global warming. We investigated whole-reach NO3 (-) uptake and denitrification in nine semiarid streams of variable water salinity (i.e. from freshwater to hyposaline) to test if NO3 (-) processing would decrease with increasing salinity. We used pulse additions and Tracer Addition for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) to measure whole-reach uptake of added NO3 (-), and the acetylene block technique to measure sediment denitrification. TASCC results showed that only five of nine streams were able to retain added NO3 (-). Of these five retentive streams, four were saline; however, salinity did not control significantly the variation in whole-reach NO3 (-) uptake observed across streams. Other measured environmental variables such as streambed NH4 (+) and organic carbon availability were better at explaining this variation. Denitrification was detected in all streams except one and its variation across streams was also independent of salinity. Although denitrification rates tended to be high, their contribution to whole-reach NO3 (-) uptake was insignificant (a parts per thousand currency sign2.16 %). Alternative pathways, heterotrophic assimilation and/or dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction to NH4 (+), were probably responsible for most whole-reach NO3 (-) uptake. Together, our results highlight that the function of streams in controlling external NO3 (-) inputs is highly variable and salinity does not apparently constrain this role.",AQUATIC SCIENCES,76,2,,295,311,,10.1007/s00027-014-0336-9,,,,,,1015-1621; 1420-9055,,WOS:000333079100011

However, rainfall-runoff models are generally not well suited for use in ephemeral river systems because of their inability to simulate abrupt transitions from flow to no-flow periods and the highly non-linear rainfall-runoff relationships that exist in low yielding catchments.

This paper discusses the role of a karst aquifer system in the flash floods of a Mediterranean river, the Lez river. Most of the Lez river watershed is located on karst terrains where interactions between surface water and groundwater take place. During extreme rainfall events, the presence of fractures and well-developed karst features in carbonate terrains enhances the infiltration processes and involves the concentration of the recharge into highly organized and permeable flow paths. The groundwater, therefore, quickly moves towards the natural outlets of the karst system. The influence of the Lez karst aquifer system on the associated river floods dynamics is analysed while considering the spatially distributed rainfall, as well as the time series of the groundwater level within the aquifer and of the Lez river discharge measured at various gauging stations. Special attention is given to the relative importance of the surface and underground processes involved in flash flood genesis. It is shown that the karst groundwater contributes to flash floods under certain conditions, while high-rate pumping within the karst aquifer, which generates significant drawdown, may mitigate flash floods under other conditions.",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,71,2,SI,573,583,,10.1007/s12665-013-2678-3,,,,,,1866-6280; 1866-6299,,WOS:000329996200008

An important parameter in hydraulic modeling is the Manning's coefficient, an indicator of the channel resistance which is directly dependent on riparian vegetation changes. Riparian vegetation's effect on flood propagation parameters such as water depth (inundation), discharge, flow velocity, and sediment transport load is investigated in this study. Based on the obtained results, when the weed-cutting percentage is increased, the flood wave depth decreases while flow discharge, velocity and sediment transport load increase. The proposed modeling system is used to evaluate and illustrate the flood hazard for different riparian vegetation cutting scenarios. For the estimation of flood hazard, a combination of the flood propagation characteristics of water depth, flow velocity and sediment load was used. Next, a well-balanced selection of the most appropriate agricultural cutting practices of riparian vegetation was performed. Ultimately, the model results obtained for different agricultural cutting practice scenarios can be employed to create flood protection measures for flood-prone areas.

The studied stretches suffered minimal human disturbances, displayed semi-arid conditions, and had wide riparian areas to allow the development of the target species: black alder (Alnus glutinosa), salvia leaf willow (Salix salviifolia), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and oleander (Nerium oleander). Thalweg height was used to define the riverbank topographic gradient. The results showed a preferential zone for black alder and salvia leaf willow in the range of 0-150 cm from the channel thalweg, with adult alders and willows being more common between 51 and 150 cm and young alders being more common under 50 cm. Conversely, narrow-leafed ash and oleander were much more frequent, and showed greater development, in the ranges of 151-200 cm and 201-250 cm, respectively, whereas the young feet of both species covered the entire topographic range. Adult feet of the four species were spatially segregated along the riverbank topographic gradient, indicating their differential ability to cope with water stress from the non-tolerant alders and willows to more tolerant narrow-leafed ash trees and oleanders. Young feet, however, showed a strategy more closely linked to the initial availability of colonisation sites within riparian areas to the dispersion strategy of each species and to the distribution of adult feet.

Assessment,2014,"Maigret, Thomas A.; Cox, John J.; Schneider, Dylan R.; Barton, Chris D.; Price, Steven J.; Larkin, Jeffery L.",Effects of timber harvest within streamside management zones on salamander populations in ephemeral streams of southeastern Kentucky,"Timber harvest is an important extractive, economic activity to many human economies, but it can be detrimental to ecosystem function and species viability therein by degrading and fragmenting forest habitat. Salamanders comprise a significant amount of forest community biomass, and given their sensitivity to environmental stressors, including those caused by timber harvest, they often serve as important indicators of declines in forest ecosystem function. Several studies have focused on the impacts of timber harvest on salamanders inhabiting perennial and intermittent streams, the findings of which have helped inform best management practices for timber harvest in the U.S. Ephemeral headwater streams and associated riparia account for a small fraction of the total landscape, yet these features are critical to the functioning of forested ecosystems; however, few studies have examined how timber harvest impacts salamanders in or near these areas. Our objective was to investigate the effects of three different silvicultural treatments, each involving different streamside management zone (SMZ) characteristics, on salamander communities in southeastern Kentucky hardwood forest ephemeral streams. Data were collected by regular checks of pitfall traps, coverboards, and transect searches. Using both pre- and post-harvest data, abundance estimates were acquired using binomial mixture models. Declines in some species of terrestrial and stream-breeding salamanders were detected, and were shown to be likely related to characteristics of the corresponding silvicultural treatment.

We mapped fish abundance and sampled microhabitat use and availability via snorkelling. We used the coefficient of dispersion in abundance, and spatial autocorrelation analyses to characterize chub distribution, and Hurdle models to relate chub presence and abundance to habitat characteristics. We showed that chub displayed an aggregated distribution, apparently in association with patchily distributed and autocorrelated physical resources, such as debris, roots and aquatic vegetation. Microhabitat use generally was unrelated to velocity, and ontogenetic differences in microhabitat use were not substantial. Nevertheless, sometimes small chub preferred low-velocity patches with coarse substrata, debris and roots, whereas large chub preferred deeper patches with roots and aquatic vegetation. Results suggest that, in low flow conditions, chub respond to resource patchiness by congregating in favourable microhabitats, and that maintenance of mosaics of patches with variable substrata, cover and depth may be important for the persistence of fish in Mediterranean streams.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,732,1,,93,109,,10.1007/s10750-014-1850-4,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000335701500008

The ability to apply bioassessment indices to nonperennial streams would greatly expand the reach of biomonitoring programs. We sampled 12 nonperennial streams (3 of which were minimally stressed) in the San Diego hydrologic region multiple times to assess whether a benthic macroinvertebrate assessment index (the Southern California Index of Biotic Integrity [IBI]) developed for perennial streams could be used in nonperennial streams. We also sampled 3 minimally stressed perennial streams. Continuous water-level loggers and repeated site visits revealed that hydrologic regimes varied considerably among streams. Gradual drying was evident at some streams, and multiple drying/rewetting events were evident at others. Moreover, streams that were nonperennial in one year were perennial in another. IBI scores from low-stress nonperennial streams were similar to those for low-stress perennial streams, and false indications of impairment (i.e., low IBI scores) were never observed. Furthermore, IBI scores declined as stress increased, suggesting that the IBI responded as expected in nonperennial streams. IBI scores were stable at most sites within and between years, but midsummer declines were observed at high-stress sites. These declines were associated with declines in discharge, fast-water habitat, and increases in sands and fines and macroalgae cover. These findings suggest that an assessment tool developed for perennial streams can be used to assess condition at certain nonperennial streams, and that biomonitoring programs can provide more comprehensive watershed assessments by including nonperennial streams in their surveys.",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,33,2,,459,474,,10.1086/675683,,,,,,2161-9549; 2161-9565,,WOS:000337521400008

F.; Arthington, Angela H.",Fish diet composition in floodplain lagoons of an Australian dryland river in relation to an extended dry period following flooding,"Floodplain rivers worldwide are threatened by loss of connectivity to their floodplains and hence reduced benefits from floodplain energy subsidies. Dryland rivers with 'boom and bust' ecological responses to flooding and extended dry periods may be particularly vulnerable. This paper describes variations in dietary composition of three fish species of contrasting trophic position in dryland floodplain lagoons with variable flood inundation and drying histories. The study species were Ambassis agassizii - a microphagic carnivore, Leiopotherapon unicolor - a carnivore/omnivore, and Nematalosa erebi - an algivore/detritivor. Despite the range of food items recorded in fish guts, each species fed mostly on relatively few food categories and few food items within each category. Most of the spatial (i.e. among lagoons) and temporal dietary variation was associated with different proportional contributions of these food items. Given the absence or low magnitude of flooding during the study period, temporal changes in diets of the three species are probably the result of successional changes in composition of invertebrate prey as the dry season progressed. The focus of each fish species on relatively few food categories and a few reliable food items within each category may be the most profitable foraging strategy when food resources are limiting in progressively drying floodplain lagoons.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,97,7,,797,812,,10.1007/s10641-013-0180-0,,,,,,0378-1909; 1573-5133,,WOS:000336445200005
Assessment,2014,"Miller, Brian W.; Doyle, Martin W.",Rangeland management and fluvial geomorphology in northern Tanzania,"Researchers have independently documented the effects of land use on rivers and threats to river management institutions, but the relationship between changes in institutional context and river condition is not well described. This study assesses the connections between resource management institutions, land use, and rivers by integrating social science, geospatial analysis, and geomorphology. In particular, we measured hydraulic geometry, sediment size distributions, and estimated sediment yield for four rivers in northern Tanzania and conducted semistructured interviews that assessed corresponding resource management institutions. Communities managed rivers through both customary (traditional, nonstate) and government institutions, but the differences in the resource management policies and practices of the study rivers themselves were fairly subtle. Clearer differences were found at broader scales; the four watersheds exhibited substantial differences in land-cover change and sediment yield associated with the location of settlements, roadways, and cultivation. Unexpectedly, these recent land-use changes did not initiate a geomorphic response in rivers. The long history of grazing by domestic and wild ungulates may have influenced water and sediment supplies such that river channel dimensions are more resistant to changes in land use than other systems or have already adjusted to predominant changes in boundary conditions. This would suggest that not all rivers will have the anticipated responses to contemporary land-use changes because of antecedent land-use patterns; over long time scales (centuries to millennia), the presence of grazers may actually increase the ability of rivers to withstand changes in land use. Our findings point to a need for further interdisciplinary study of dryland rivers and their shifts between system states, especially in areas with a long history of grazing, relatively recent changes in land use, and a dynamic social and institutional context.

Assessment,2014,"Mukherjee, Sandip; Joshi, P. K.; Garg, R. D.",A comparison of different regression models for downscaling Landsat and MODIS land surface temperature images over heterogeneous landscape,"Remotely sensed high spatial resolution thermal images are required for various applications in natural resource management. At present, availability of high spatial resolution (<200 m) thermal images are limited. The temporal resolution of such images is also low. Whereas, coarser spatial resolution (similar to 1000 m) thermal images with high revisiting capability (similar to 1 day) are freely available. To bridge this gap, present study attempts to downscale coarser spatial resolution thermal image to finer spatial resolution using relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation indices over a heterogeneous landscape of India. Five regression based models namely (i) Disaggregation of Radiometric Temperature (DisTrad), (ii) Temperature Sharpening (TsHARP), TsHARP with local variant, (iv) Least median square regression downscaling (LMSDS) and (v) Pace regression downscaling (PRDS) are applied to downscale LST of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. All the five models are first evaluated on Landsat image aggregated to 960 m resolution and downscaled to 480 m and 240 m resolution. The downscale accuracy is achieved using LMSDS and PRDS models at 240 m resolution at 0.61 degrees C and 0.75 degrees C respectively. MODIS data downscaled from 1000 m to 250 m spatial resolution results root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.43 degrees C and 1.62 degrees C for LMSDS and PRDS models, respectively. The LMSDS model is less sensitive to outliers in heterogeneous landscape and provides higher accuracy when compared to other models. Downscaling model is found to be suitable for agricultural and vegetated landscapes up to a spatial resolution of 250 m but not applicable to water bodies, dry river bed sand sandy open areas.

Assessment,2014,"Ortega, J. A.; Razola, L.; Garzon, G.",Recent human impacts and change in dynamics and morphology of ephemeral rivers,"Ephemeral streams induce flash-flood events, which cause dramatic morphological changes and impacts on population, mainly because they are intermittent and less predictable. Human pressures on the basin modify load and discharge relationships, inducing dormant instability on the fluvial system that will manifest abruptly during flood events. The flash-flood response of two ephemeral streams affected by load supply modification due to land use changes is discussed in a combination of geomorphic and hydraulic approaches. During the Rivillas flash flood, intensive clearing on the basin led to high rates of sediment flowing into an artificially straightened and inefficient channel. The stream evolved from a sinuous single channel into a shallow braiding occupying the entire width of the valley floor. Misfits and unsteady channel conditions increased velocity, stream power and sediment entrainment capacity and considerably magnified flood damage. Resulting morphosedimentary features revealed a close relationship with the valley floor post-flood hydraulic model, and pre-event awareness would have made it possible to predict risk-sensitive areas. In the second case, the Azoh a stream, modelling of current pre-flood channel conditions make it possible to determine channel narrowing and entrenchment in the lower alluvial fan stretch. Abandonment of intensive agriculture, basin reforestation and urbanization diminish load contribution and trigger channel incision. This induces an increase in slope and velocity in the bankfull channel, producing renewed erosive energy and thus activating upstream propagation of incision and bank undermining. The absence of water-spreading dynamics on the alluvial fan in favour of confinement in a single channel produces an unstable dynamic in the system, also offering a false sense of stability, as long as no large magnitude floods occur. When modelling flood-prone areas and analysing hydraulic variables, it is important to detect possible anthropic disturbances that may affect basin load budgets in order to anticipate catastrophic consequences resulting from inappropriate fluvial management before the occurrence of an extraordinary event.",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,14,3,,713,730,,10.5194/nhess-14-713-2014,,,,,,1561-8633,,WOS:000334093600017

E.",Assimilating catchment processes with monitoring data to estimate sediment loads to the Great Barrier Reef,"Quantifying riverine sediment loads, and the uncertainty around these estimates, is important for monitoring the impact of land use on ecologically sensitive receiving waters such as the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. We used a Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling approach that assimilates information from a process model for runoff, a mechanistically motivated statistical model for sediment generation and observed runoff and sediment load data. The approach was trialled on a 10-year dataset collected from a 14-km 2 sub-catchment in the Burdekin basin, Australia. Using our model, we were able to estimate daily sediment concentrations, discharges and loads (with credible intervals) over a 10-year period, including 3years where there were long periods of missing observational data. We found that for the high-frequency monitoring undertaken at the study site, credible intervals around sediment loads were narrow. Credible intervals were substantially wider in years where observational data were not available and load estimates relied on the underlying processes and neighbouring observations. The method presented here is the first attempt at assimilating discharge and concentration measurements with process models for the purpose of sediment load estimation. The potential for quantifying loads entering the Great Barrier Reef lagoon is promising, particularly for ephemeral streams that are typical of arid and semi-arid Australia.

While previous research has shown how delta N-15 of PUCs varies with delta N-15 of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) among streams, less is known about how delta N-15 of PUCs varies over time. Here, we examined monthly variation of delta N-15 of PUCs and of DIN species (nitrate and ammonium) over a year, and compared it among streams with contrasting human impacts and PUG types. Our results showed no evidence of isotopic seasonal patterns. Temporal variability in delta N-15-PUCs increased with human impact, being the highest in the urban stream, probably influenced by the high variability of delta N-15-DIN. Among compartments, in-stream PUCs characterized by fast turnover rates, such as filamentous algae, showed the highest temporal variability in delta N-15 values (from -3.6 to 23.2 parts per thousand).

Yet, crop-raiding patterns are poorly understood, making prediction and protection difficult. We hypothesized that raiding elephants use corridors between daytime refuges and farmland. Elephant counts, crop-raiding records, household surveys, Bayesian expert system, and least-cost path simulation were used to predict four alternative categories of daily corridors: (1) footpaths, (2) dry river beds, (3) stepping stones along scattered small farms, and (4) trajectories of shortest distance to refuges. The corridor alignments were compared in terms of their minimum cumulative resistance to elephant movement and related to crop-raiding zones quantified by a kernel density function. The ""stepping stone"" corridors predicted the crop-raiding patterns. Elephant presence was confirmed along these corridors, demonstrating that small farms located between refuges and contiguous farmland increase habitat connectivity for elephant.

After a general introduction and a summary of the origins of biomonitoring in Spain, the authors examine the papers on this topic published in the Limnetica journal. The authors use the data of such papers to illustrate the points that have to be taken into account in order to design biomonitoring programs, and summarized these ideas in a Decalogue. The Decalogue contents all required steps to produce a proper biomonitoring system that will be normative compliant with the specifications of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The 10 parts of the Decalogue are: 1) how to establish a sampling network; 2) human and material resources available for sampling; 3) definition of the river typologies; 4) how to establish the reference conditions; 5) sampling protocols to be used; 6) biological metrics to be applied; 7) setting the threshold between the different quality classes and its relationship with the pressures; 8) ecological quality maps and output system by using the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio); 9) quality standards and control; 10) setting the quality objectives and definition of the adequate measures to recover water quality issues.

Most of the published papers in biomonitoring used macroinvertebrates (88 %), while less than 20 % used the reference condition and/or river typology approach to set the quality classes thresholds. However, despite the existence of the WFD since the year 2000, many papers published in Limnetica after 2002 (at this year a Limnetica's special issue on biomonitoring in Mediterranean streams was published), do not met the requirements of this Directive.

Assessment,2014,"Reynolds, L. V.; Cooper, D. J.; Hobbs, N. T.",DRIVERS OF RIPARIAN TREE INVASION ON A DESERT STREAM,"Understanding mechanisms of exotic species' invasions is essential to managing riparian landscapes throughout the world. In the southwestern USA, the two most dominant invaders of riparian habitats are the exotic tree species tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima, Tamarix chinensis, and their hybrids) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). These plants were introduced around 1900, and their success may be facilitated by river regulation, river channel changes, and precipitation patterns. We hypothesized that riparian invasion in Canyon de Chelly, Arizona, was initiated by a change point event such as plantings, dam construction, or channel incision and that establishment near a change point was tied to flood events. We aged tamarisk, Russian olive, and native cottonwood trees from study sites in Canyon de Chelly and used tree ring analysis to determine the year of establishment and the elevation of the germination point relative to the channel. We used Bayesian Poisson regression and information theoretics to identify change points and precipitation variables driving annual tree establishment. We found that most tamarisk and Russian olive trees established in the late 1980s, and most cottonwoods established in 1930-1950 and 1980-2000. Regression models indicated that change points occurred in 1983 for Russian olive and 1988 for tamarisk, and precipitation was important for establishment. Although plantings and river regulation probably played a role in tree invasion, our results suggest that these species required precipitation and stream channel change for widespread establishment in Canyon de Chelly. The factors driving riparian invasions may not be those often associated with degraded rivers, such as altered hydrographs and land management changes, thus requiring analyses of the full range of ecological and physical processes.

Assessment,2014,"Rigge, Matthew; Smart, Alexander; Wylie, Bruce; Kamp, Kendall Vande",Detecting the Influence of Best Management Practices on Vegetation Near Ephemeral Streams With Landsat Data,"Various best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented on rangelands with the goals of controlling nonpoint source pollution, reducing the impact of livestock in ecologically important riparian areas, and improving grazing distribution. Providing off-stream water sources to livestock in pastures, cross-fencing, and rotational grazing are common rangeland BMPs that have demonstrated success in drawing livestock grazing pressure away from streams. We evaluated the effects of rangeland BMP implementation with six commercial-scale pastures in the northern mixed-grass prairie. Four pastures received a BMP suite consisting of off-stream water, cross-fencing, and deferred-rotation grazing, and two pastures did not receive BMPs. We hypothesized that the BMPs increased the quantity of riparian vegetation cover relative to the conditions in these pastures during the pre-BMP period and to the two pastures that did not receive BMPs. We used a series of 30-m Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to track the spatial and temporal changes (1984-2010, n=24) in vegetation cover, to which NDVI has been well correlated. Validation indicated that the remotely sensed signal from in-channel vegetation was representative of ground conditions. The BMP suite was associated with a 15% increase in the in-channel NDVI (0-30 m from stream centerline) and 18% increase in the riparian NDVI (30-180 m from stream center line). Conversely, the in-channel and riparian NDVI of non-BMP pastures declined 30% and 18% over the study period. The majority of change occurred within 2 yr of BMP implementation. The patterns of in-channel NDVI among pastures suggested that BMP implementation likely altered grazing distribution by decreasing the preferential use of riparian and in-channel areas.

The results of stream water analysis revealed that all sites exhibit good to high chemical-physicochemical quality. Overall, low stream water conductivities were recorded due to the siliceous substrate. Higher major ion, nitrate and nitrite levels during high flow periods were attributed to flashing processes, whereas higher ammonia and phosphate levels in summer were due to natural (organic matter mineralization in pools) and semi-natural pressures. Cold springs revealed good drinking water quality,. while hot springs (used for curative drinking purposes) exceeded drinking water quality standards. Regarding bioassessment, stream sites varied from good to high quality, apart from one that varied from good to moderate.

However, the degree of alteration and associated ecological change may depend on pre-existing hydrologic regimes. We used long-term datasets to compare downstream hydrological and fish assemblage responses to impoundment in two catchments classified as having intermittent and perennial-flashy natural hydrologic regimes. We observed significant shifts in fish assemblage structure at both sites after stream impoundment. The historically intermittent stream shifted to a stable perennial flow regime. Changes in fish assemblage structure covaried with changes in five different components of the flow regime; most species that increased in abundance require fluvial habitats and likely benefited from increased flows during historically low flow seasons. Shifts in fish assemblage structure were also observed in the perennial stream, despite minimal flow alteration after impoundment; however, most species shifts were associated with lentic environments, and were more likely related to proximity of reservoirs in the drainage system rather than changes in stream flow. Findings from this study confirm that downstream fish assemblage response to river impoundment can be associated with high levels of hydrologic alteration, but other factors including expansion of lentic species into lotic environments also influence shifts in assemblage structure.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,728,1,,23,39,,10.1007/s10750-013-1797-x,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000332745800002

During cease to flow conditions, biofilms on streambed sediments may be exposed to desiccation. Environmental conditions and resource availability change with desiccation and may influence biofilm functioning and whole stream ecosystem processes. Rainfall events during the nonflow phase can rehydrate streambed sediments, but the effect of these pulses on biofilm functioning is unclear. This study aimed to analyze the effects of a rehydration event on biofilm functional diversity during the nonflow period in a subtropical Australian stream. Biofilms from three different stream pools on the same reach; one permanently water-covered and the other two differing in their desiccation time were studied. Biofilms initially differed owing to the time they were exposed to dry conditions but rehydration events significantly increased biofilm functional diversity, producing a ""reset"" effect on the desiccation exposure, as after that bacterial functioning decreased again because of the new dry conditions. The observed rapid biofilm responses to rehydration during flow intermittency might be essential in sustaining biofilm functional diversity in intermittent streams.",HYDROBIOLOGIA,727,1,,185,195,,10.1007/s10750-013-1802-4,,,,,,0018-8158; 1573-5117,,WOS:000330967900014
Biogeochemistry,2014,"Tzoraki, O.; Cooper, D.; Doerflinger, G.; Panagos, P.",A new MONERIS in-Stream Retention Module to Account Nutrient Budget of a Temporary River in Cyprus,"The nature of the nutrient budget for temporary rivers differs from that for permanent rivers because of the restricted nature of flow, the lack of adequate dilution, and weather conditions which are conducive to the development of algal blooms. We analyse the nutrient budget of three tributaries of a temporary river in Cyprus, the Kouris, with the aid of the MONERIS model. MONERIS in-stream retention module was modified to account for a 1-dimensional advection - dispersion pollutants transport rather than the general mass balance equation for mixed reactors. TRS plot classified Kryos stream as an Intermittent flow - Dry (I-D) stream (hydrologically altered) and Kouris and Limnatis as Intermittent - Pool (I-P) streams that need different lumped parameterization in MONERIS simulation. Point sources are important for nitrogen (64 %) and phosphorous emissions (22 %), and diffuse sources for nitrogen via erosion (15 %) and free grazing (12 %) and for phosphorous via free grazing (8 %). We estimate that around 40 % of N and 88 % of P entering streams is retained in the stream. An analysis of the model uncertainty and sensitivity to input data indicates that MONERIS model, even in semi-arid areas, may be used for the purpose of managing river basins.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,28,10,,2917,2935,,10.1007/s11269-014-0646-7,,,,,,0920-4741; 1573-1650,,WOS:000338651100013

Nitrate concentration (mean value) was increased in the Limnatis (2.8 mg L-1) tributary in comparison with the Kryos (2.1 mg L-1) and Kouris (1.0 mg L-1) tributaries depicting the influence of anthropogenic activities. The total maximum daily nutrients loads (TMDLs) based on the flow duration curves approach, showed that nutrients loads exceeded threshold values (33.3-75.6% in all hydrologic condition classes in the Kouris tributary, and 65-78% in the Limnatis tributary) especially under low flow conditions. The TMDL graph is intended to guide the temporal schedule for chemical sampling in all hydrologic classes. Kouris reservoir is an oligotrophic system, strongly influenced by the river's flash-flood character but also by the implemented management practices. Kouris river outflow, which was reduced to one-tenth in the post dam period altered the wetland hydrologic network and contributed to the decrease of aquifer thickness. Continuous evaluation and update of the River Basin Management Plans will be the basis for the sustainable development of the Kouris basin.",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,69,4,,847,854,,10.2166/wst.2013.783,,,,,,0273-1223; 1996-9732,,WOS:000332512200022

We use field monitoring and modelling tools to estimate nutrient sources and transfer in both high and low flow conditions. Inverse modelling by the help of PHREEQC model validated the hypothesis of a losing stream during the dry period. Soil and Water Assessment Tool model captured the water quality of the basin. The 'total daily maximum load' approach is used to estimate the nutrient flux status by flow class, indicating that almost 60 % of the river network fails to meet nitrogen criteria and 50 % phosphate criteria. We recommend that existing well-documented remediation measures such as reforestation of the riparian area or composting of food process biosolids should be implemented to achieve load reduction in close conjunction with social needs.",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,186,4,,2243,2257,,10.1007/s10661-013-3533-4,,,,,,0167-6369; 1573-2959,,WOS:000332150800021
Assessment,2014,"Urrea-Clos, Gemma; Garcia-Berthou, Emili; Sabater, Sergi",Factors explaining the patterns of benthic chlorophyll-a distribution in a large agricultural Iberian watershed (Guadiana river),"Benthic algal biomass depends on a number of variables, including local factors such as the ionic water composition, nutrient availability, light, or water velocity, and large-scale factors such as the drainage area and land uses in the watershed. The relative roles of local and large-scale factors affecting benthic chlorophyll variation were analyzed in the Guadiana watershed by means of variation partitioning and partial least squares regression. The potential relevance of 20 physical, chemical and physiographical variables was analyzed throughout the watershed, and separately in three distinct geological units: upper watershed calcareous streams, streams with siliceous bedrocks, and the main river reaches. Our results suggest that many predictors of algal biomass are intercorrelated but have independent effects, and that their importance varies between geological units. Nutrient content and land uses exerted the largest influence on the pattern of chlorophyll-a variation in the three ecotypes studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment,2014,"Yu, Yilei; Song, Xianfang; Zhang, Yinghua; Zheng, Fandong; Liang, Ji; Liu, Licai","Identifying spatio-temporal variation and controlling factors of chemistry in groundwater and river water recharged by reclaimed water at Huai River, North China","Reclaimed water is efficiently used to recover the dry river, but river water and groundwater may be impacted considering the water quality. Thus, it is critical to study the factors controlling water chemistry. Samples of reclaimed water, river and groundwater were collected monthly from January to September in 2010, in Huai River (North China). And samples were analyzed for major 15 physio-chemical parameters. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, 9 months are divided into two distinct groups, which show the clear temporal variation. In reclaimed water and river water, one group includes February, while the other includes other months. In shallow and deep groundwater, one group includes months from January to April, while the other encompasses others. Monitoring stations are classified into three groups. Group A with high value of ions and nitrogen (order: NH4-N > NO3-N > NO2-N) includes reclaimed water and river water. Group B with moderate concentration and nitrogen (order: NO3-N > NH4-N > NO2-N) includes all shallow groundwater and one deep groundwater. Group C with the low value and nitrogen (order: NO3-N > NO2-N > NH4-N), includes two deep groundwater. Using multivariate analysis and ionic relationships, river water chemistry is found to be controlled by reclaimed water and evaporation process; chemistry in shallow groundwater and one deep groundwater, with type of Na-Ca(Mg)-HCO3-Cl, is controlled by dissolution of calcite, carbonate weathering. Additionally, reactions of nitrification, denitrification and cation exchange occur in the infiltration of reclaimed water; chemistry in the other deep groundwater, with type of Ca-Mg-HCO3-Cl, is controlled by dissolution of calcite, carbonate weathering and denitrification.",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,28,5,SI,1135,1145,,10.1007/s00477-013-0803-1,,,,,,1436-3240; 1436-3259,,WOS:000336052800006
"Biogeochemistry, Assessment",2014,"Zoppini, Annamaria; Ademollo, Nicoletta; Amalfitano, Stefano; Casella, Patrizia; Patrolecco, Luisa; Polesello, Stefano",Organic priority substances and microbial processes in river sediments subject to contrasting hydrological conditions,"Flood and drought events of higher intensity and frequency are expected to increase in arid and semi-arid regions, in which temporary rivers represent both a water resource and an aquatic ecosystem to be preserved. In this study, we explored the variation of two classes of hazardous substances (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Nonylphenols) and the functioning of the microbial community in river sediments subject to hydrological fluctuations (Candelaro river basin, Italy). Overall, the concentration of pollutants (Sigma PAHs range 8-275 ng g(-1); Sigma NPs range 299-4858 ng g(-1)) suggests a moderate degree of contamination. The conditions in which the sediments were tested, flow (high/low) and no flow (wet/dry/arid), were associated to significant differences in the chemical and microbial properties. The total organic carbon contribution decreased together with the stream flow reduction, while the contribution of C-PAHs and C-NPs tended to increase. NPs were relatively more concentrated in sediments under high flow, while the more hydrophobic PAHs accumulated under low and no flow conditions. Passing from high to no flow conditions, a gradual reduction of microbial processes was observed, to reach the lowest specific bacterial carbon production rates (0.06 fmol C h(-1) cell(-1)), extracellular enzyme activities, and the highest doubling time (40 h) in arid sediments.In conclusion, different scenarios for the mobilization of pollutants and microbial processes can be identified under contrasting hydrological conditions: (i) the mobilization of pollutants under high flow and a relatively higher probability for biodegradation; (ii) the accumulation of pollutants during low flow and lower probability for biodegradation; (iii) the drastic reduction of pollutant concentrations under dry and arid conditions, probably independently from the microbial activity (abiotic processes). Our findings let us infer that a multiple approach. has to be considered for an appropriate water resource exploitation and a more realistic prevision of the impact of pollutants in temporary waters.
