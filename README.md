# Topic modelling on non-perennial stream research

This repo includes **R scripts** I developed to apply **topic modelling** to identify research trends and knowledge gaps in existing non-perennial stream studies.

- We first apply topic modelling on a set of literature that has been reviewed by researchers and compare topic concordance between topic modelling and the traditional literature review approach that rely on researchers to identify topics from literature. (Aim 1)
- We then apply topic modelling on all relevant non-perennial stream studies between 1966 and 2021 to identify emergent research topics, trends in topical popularity over time, and potential knowledge gaps. (Aim 2)

R scripts for Aim 1:
- '01_dtm preparation.R'
- '02_Four topics_LDA vs Leigh review.R'

R scripts for Aim 2:
- '05_LDA on all literature_NotLimitedToLeighsTerms.R'

The scripts work with the files in the 'Data' folder.

The topic modelling work is currently under peer-review and the paper describing this study will be made available after the review process.

All scripts are developed/maintained by Songyan (Sunny) Yu (Email - sunny.yu@griffith.edu.au)
